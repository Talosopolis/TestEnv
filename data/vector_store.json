It carefully develops, giving all steps, the principles \nof differentiation and integration on which the whole of calculus is built. The book is suitable for \nreviewing the subject, or as a self-contained text for an elementary calculus course.\nThe author has found that many of the difficulties students encounter in calculus are due to weakness in \nalgebra and arithmetical computation, emphasis has been placed on reviewing algebraic and \narithmetical techniques whenever they are used. Every effort has been made\u2014especially in regard to \nthe composition of the solved problems\u2014 to ease the beginner's entry into calculus. There are also some \n1500 supplementary problems (with a complete set of answers at the end of the book). \nHigh school courses in calculus can readily use this Outline. Many of the problems are adopted from \nquestions that have appeared in the Advanced Placement Examination in Calculus, so that students will \nautomatically receive preparation for that test.\nThe Second Edition has been improved by the following changes:\n1. A large number of problems have been added to take advantage of the availability of graphing \ncalculators. Such problems are preceded by the notation . Solution of these problems is not \nnecessary for comprehension of the text, so that students not having a graphing calculator will not \nsuffer seriously from that lack (except insofar as the use of a graphing calculator enhances their \nunderstanding of the subject).\n2. Treatment of several topics have been expanded:\n(a) Newton's Method is now the subject of a separate section. The availability of calculators makes \nit much easier to work out concrete problems by this method.\n(b) More attention and more problems are devoted to approximation techniques for integration, such \nas the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and the midpoint rule.\n(c) The chain rule now has a complete proof outlined in an exercise.\n3. The exposition has been streamlined in many places and a substantial number of new problems have \nbeen added.\nThe author wishes to thank again the editor of the First Edition, David Beckwith, as well as the editor of \nthe Second Edition, Arthur Biderman, and the editing supervisor, Maureen Walker.\nELLIOTT MENDELSON\n\nThis page intentionally left blank \nContents\nChapter 1 \nCoordinate Systems on a Line\n 1\n1.1 The Coordinates of a Point\n1\n1.2 Absolute Value\n2\nChapter 2 \nCoordinate Systems in a Plane\n8\n2.1 The Coordinates of a Point\n8\n2.2 The Distance Formula\n9\n2.3 The Midpoint Formulas\n10\nChapter 3 \nGraphs of Equations\n14\nChapter 4 \nStraight Lines\n24\n4.1 Slope\n24\n4.2 Equations of a Line\n27\n4.3 Parallel Lines\n28\n4.4 Perpendicular Lines\n29\nChapter 5 \nIntersections of Graphs\n36\nChapter 6 \nSymmetry\n41\n6.1 Symmetry about a Line\n41\n \n  \n \nChapter 7 \nFunctions and Their Graphs\n46\n7.1 The Notion of a Function 46\n7.2 Intervals 48\n7.3 Even and Odd Functions 50\n7.4 Algebra Review: Zeros of Polynomials 51\nChapter 8 \nLimits\n59\n8.1 Introduction 59\n8.2 Properties of Limits 59\n8.3 Existence or Nonexistence of the Limit 61\nChapter 9 \nSpecial Limits\n 67\n9.1 One-Sided Limits\n67\n9.2 Infinite Limits: Vertical Asymptotes\n68\n9.3 Limits at Infinity: Horizontal Asymptotes\n70\nChapter 10 \nContinuity\n78\n10.1 Definition and Properties\n78\n10.2 One-Sided Continuity\n79\n10.3 Continuity over a Closed Interval\n80\n6.2 Symmetry about a Point 42\nChapter 11 \nThe Slope of a Tangent Line\n 86\nChapter 12 \nThe Derivative\n92\nChapter 13 \nMore on the Derivative\n99\n13.1 Differentiability and Continuity\n99\n13.2 Further Rules for Derivatives\n100\nChapter 14 \nMaximum and Minimum Problems\n104\n14.1 Relative Extrema\n104\n14.2 Absolute Extrema\n105\nChapter 15 \nThe Chain Rule\n116\n15.1 Composite Functions\n116\n \n15.2 Differentiation of Composite Functions 117\nChapter 16 \nImplicit Differentiation\n126\nChapter 17 \nThe Mean-Value Theorem and the Sign of the Derivative\n129\n17.1 Rolle's Theorem and the Mean-Value Theorem 129\n17.2 The Sign of the Derivative 130\n \n  \nChapter 18 \nRectilinear Motion and Instantaneous Velocity\n 136\nChapter 19 \nInstantaneous Rate of Change\n143\nChapter 20 \nRelated Rates\n147\nChapter 21 \nApproximation by Differentials;

Choose a point 0 on the line and call this point the origin. \nNow select a direction along 9; say, the direction from left to right on the diagram. \nFor every point P to the right of the origin 0, let the coordinate of P be the distance between 0 and P. \n(Of course, to specify such a distance, it is first necessary to establish a unit distance by arbitrarily \npicking two points and assigning the number 1 to the distance between these two points.) \nIn the diagram \nthe distance is assumed to be 1, so that the coordinate of A is 1. The point B is two units away from \n0; therefore, B has coordinate 2. Every positive real number r is the coordinate of a unique point on 9 \nto the right of the origin 0; namely, of that point to the right of 0 whose distance from 0 is r. \nTo every point Q on 9 to the left of the origin 0, \n- we assign a negative real number as its coordinate; the number -Q0, the negative of the distance \nbetween Q and 0. For example, in the diagram \nthe point U is assumed to be a distance of one unit from the origin 0; therefore, the coordinate of U is \n- 1. The point W has coordinate -4, which means that the distance is *. Clearly, every negative \nreal number is the coordinate of a unique point on 9 to the left of the origin. \nThe origin 0 is assigned the number 0 as its coordinate. \n1 \n[CHAP. 1 2 COORDINATE SYSTEMS ON A LINE \nThis assignment of real numbers to the points on the line 9 is called a coordinate system on 9. \nChoosing a different origin, a different direction along the line, or a different unit distance would result \nin a different coordinate system. \n1.2 ABSOLUTE VALUE \nFor any real number b define the absolute value I b I to be the magnitude of b; that is, \nb ifb20 \n-6 ifb<O lbl= \nIn other words, if b is a positive number or zero, its absolute value I b I is 6 itself. But if b is negative, its \nabsolute value I b I is the corresponding positive number - b. \nEXAMPLES \nProperties of the Absolute Value \nNotice that any number r and its negative -r have the same absolute value, \nIrl = 1-4 (1.1) \n(1 4 \nlal = lbl implies a= +b (1 -3) \nla12 = a\u2018 (1.4) \nAn important special case of (1.1) results from choosing r = U - U and recalling that -(U - U) = U - U, \nlu - U1 = lu - U1 \nIf I a I = I b I, then either a and b are the same number or a and b are negatives of each other, \nMoreover, since I a I is either a or -a, and ( -a)\u2019 = a\u2019, \nReplacing a in (1 4) by ab yields \nI ab l2 = (ab)2 = a2b2 = I U 1\u2019 I b 1\u2019 = (I U I I b I)\u2019 \nwhence, the absolute value being nonnegative, \nlab1 = lallbl \nAbsolute Value and Distance \nConsider a coordinate system on a line 9 and let A, and A2 be points on 9 with coordinates a, \nand a2. Then \nI a, - a2 I = A,A2 = distance between A, and A2 (1.6) \nCHAP. 13 \nEXAMPLES \nCOORDINATE SYSTEMS ON A LINE 3 \n012 345 \nI..

If a is the coordinate of A, then \nI a I = distance between A and the origin \nNotice that, for any positive number c, \nlul I c is equivalent to -c I u I c \n1 1 1 *Y \n1 1 1 \n-C 0 C \nEXAMPLE lul S 3 ifand only if -3 I U I 3. \nSimilarly, lul < c is equivalent to -c < U < c (1.9) \nEXAMPLE To find a simpler form for the condition I x - 3 I < 5, substitute x - 3 for U in (1.9), obtaining \n- 5 < x - 3 < 5. Adding 3, we have - 2 < x < 8. From a geometric standpoint, note that I x - 3 I < 5 is equivalent \nto saying that the distance between the point A having coordinate x and the point having coordinate 3 is less than 5. \nI 1 I \nI 1 1 Y \n-2 3 8 \nIt follows immediately from the definition of the absolute value that, for any two numbers a and b, \n-1al I a I lal and -161 I 6 I lbl \n(In fact, either a = I a I or a = -1 a I.) Adding the inequalities, we obtain \n(-14) +(-lbl) I a + b 2s I4 + lbl \n-(lal+ 161) I U + 6 I lal+ lbl \nand so, by(1.8), with u = a + 6 and c = lal + Ibl, \nla + 61 lal+ 161 (1.10) \nThe inequality (1.10) is known as the triangle inequality. In (1.20) the sign c applies if and only if a and \nb are of opposite signs. \nEXAMPLE 13 + (-2)( = 11 I = 1, but 131 + 1-21 = 3 + 2= 5. \n4 COORDINATE SYSTEMS ON A LINE [CHAP. 1 \nSolved Problems \n1.1 Recalling that & always denotes the nonnegatiue square root of U, (a) evaluate fl; (b) evalu- \nate ,/m; (c) show that ,/? = I x I.

This is equivalent, upon division by 3, to - 1 < x < - 3. \nI 1 b \n-1 - 113 0 \n1.4 Solve 15 - 3x I < 2. \nBy (1.9), - 2 < 5 - 3x < 2. Subtracting 5, - 7 < - 3x < - 3. Dividing by - 3,; > x > 1. \n~ ~ ~ \nALGEBRA REVIEW Multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number reuerses the \ninequality: if U < b and c < 0, then uc > bc. \nTo see this, notice that a < b implies b - a > 0. Hence, (b - U)C < 0, since the product of a positive \nnumber and a negative number is negative. So bc - ac < 0, or bc < ac. \n1.5 Solve \n- \nI 1 11 \n7 \nI I 1. b \n0 1 23 \nx+4<2 x-3 \nWe cannot simply multiply both sides by x - 3, because we do not know whether x - 3 is positive or \nnegative. \nCase 1: x - 3 > 0. Multiplying (1) by this positive quantity preserves the inequality: \nx + 4 < 2~ - 6 \n4 < x - 6 [subtract x] \n10 < x [add 61 \nThus, if x > 3, (1) holds if and only if x > 10. \nCase 2: x - 3 < 0. Multiplying (1) by this negative quantity reverses the inequality: \nx + 4 > 2~ - 6 \n4 > x - 6 \n10 > x [add 61 \n[subtract x] \nCHAP. 13 COORDINATE SYSTEMS ON A LINE 5 \nThus, if x < 3, (1) holds if and only if x < 10. But x < 3 implies that x < 10. Hence, when x < 3, (1) is true. \nFrom cases 1 and 2, (1) holds for x > 10 and for x < 3. \n0 3 10 \n1.6 Solve (x - 2Xx + 3) > 0. \nA product is positive if and only if both factors are of like sign. \nCase 1: x - 2 > 0 and x + 3 > 0. Then x > 2 and x > -3. But \nx > 2 implies x > - 3. \nCase2: x-2<0 and x+3<0. Then x<2 and x<-3, \nx < -3 implies x < 2. \nThus, (x - 2)(x + 3) > 0 holds when either x > 2 or x < -3. \nthese are equivalent to \nwhich are equivalent \nx > 2 alone, since \nto x < -3, since \n-3 -2 -I 0 1 2 \n1.7 Solve I3x - 2 I 2 1. \nLet us solve the negation of the given relation, I3x - 2 I < 1. By (2.9), \n-1<3x-2<1 \n1<3x<3 [add 21 \n+<X<l [divide by 31 \nTherefore, the solution of I3x - 2 I 2 1 is x 5 4 or x 2 1. \nI \n3 1 \n1.8 Solve (x - 3Kx - 1)(x + 2) > 0. \nThe crucial points are x = 3, x = 1, and x = -2, where the product is zero. When x > 3, all three \nfactors are positive and the product is positive. As we pass from right to left through x = 3, the factor \n(x - 3) changes from positive to negative, and so the product will be negative between 1 and 3. As we pass \nfrom right to left through x = 1, the factor (x - 1) changes from positive to negative, and so the product \nchanges back from negative to positive throughout the interval between x = -2 and x = 1. Finally, as we \npass from right to left through x = -2, the factor (x + 2) changes from positive to negative, and so the \nproduct becomes negative for all x < -2. \n+ + \n1 1 I \nI I I Y \n-2 I 3 \nThus, the solution consists of all x such that x > 3 or -2 < x < 1. \nSupplementary Problems \n1.9 (a) For what kind of number u is I u I = -U?

[Hint: Consider three cases: (a) A, and A, on the positive x-axis or at the origin; (b) A, and A, \non the negative x-axis or at the origin; (c) A, and A, on opposite sides of the origin.] \nChapter 2 \nCoordinate Systems in a Plane \n2.1 THE COORDINATES OF A POINT \nWe shall establish a correspondence between the points of a plane and pairs of real numbers. \nChoose two perpendicular lines in the plane of Fig. 2-1. Let us assume for the sake of simplicity that \none of the lines is horizontal and the other vertical. The horizontal line will be called the x-axis and the \nvertical line will be called the y-axis. \nc \n:L \u2018I 1 \n-lt \nFig. 2-1 \nNext choose a coordinate system on the x-axis and one on the y-axis. The origin for both coordi- \nnate systems is taken to be the point 0, where the axes intersect. The x-axis is directed from left to right, \nthe y-axis from bottom to top. The part of the x-axis with positive coordinates is called the positioe \nx-axis, and the part of the y-axis with positive coordinates the positive y-axis. \nConsider any point P in the plane. Take the vertical line through the point P, and let a be the \ncoordinate of the point where the line intersects the x-axis. This number a is called the x-coordinate of P \n(or the a6scissa of P). Now take the horizontal line through P, and let 6 be the coordinate of the point \nwhere the line intersects the y-axis. The number 6 is called the y-coordinate of P (or the ordinate of P). \nEvery point has a unique pair (a, b) of coordinates associated with it. \nEXAMPLES In Fig. 2-2, the coordinates of several points have been indicated. We have limited ourselves to \ninteger coordinates only for simplicity. \nConversely, every pair (a, 6) of real numbers is associated with a unique point in the plane. \nEXAMPLES In the coordinate system of Fig. 2-3, to find the point having coordinates (3, 2), start at the origin 0, \nmove three units to the right and then two units upward. To find the point with coordinates (-2, 4), start at the \norigin 0, move two units to the left and then four units upward. To find the point with coordinates (- 1, - 3), start \nfrom the origin, move one unit to the left and then three units downward. \nGiven a coordinate system, the entire plane except for the points on the coordinate axes can be \ndivided into four equal parts, called quadrants. All points with both coordinates positive form the first \nquadrant, quadrant I, in the upper right-hand corner (see Fig. 2-4). Quadrant I1 consists of all points \nwith negative x-coordinate and positive y-coordinate; quadrants I11 and IV are also shown in Fig. 2-4. \n8 \nCHAP. 23 \n4Y (-2.4) \nT 4 \nI \n4 \n4- \n(-2.3) 3- 0 (3.3) \n2- 0 (2.2) (5.2) + I \n(3.0) 1 \n-I + 1-1- \nI- (-4,I) \n1 111 1 IAI 1 \n-4 -3 -2-10 I 2 3 4 5 x %+* \n\u2018 -2, \n4 \n0 (-3. -2) -2(C (0, -2) \n-3 - 0 (4, -3) (-1,-3) 1 -3 \nCOORDINATE SYSTEMS IN A PLANE \n4Y \n4- \n3- \n2- 9 (3*2) \n1- \n3 4 5x \n- \n9 \n11 3- \n(-1.2) 0 2 \n(-. +) \nI 1 I \n-3 -2 -1 0 \n0 (-3,-1) -1 \n4Y \nI \n(+* +) \n- \nI\u2019 0 (2.1) \nI1 I \n1 2 3 \n- \nFig. 2-4 \nThe points having coordinates of the form (0, b) are precisely the points on the y-axis.

We wish to find a formula for the distance PIP2. \nLet R be the point where the vertical line through P, intersects the horizontal line through P,. \nClearly, the x-coordinate of R is x2 , the same as that of P,; and the y-coordinate of R is y,, the same as \nthat of P,. By the Pythagorean theorem, \n- \n= Fp2 + P,R2 \nNow if A, .and A, are the projections of P, and P2 on the x-axis, the segments P,R and A,& \nare opposite sides of a rectangle. Hence, P,R = A,& But A,A2 = Ix, - x, I by (1.6). Thus, -- \n= I x, - x2 I. Similarly, P, R = I y1 - y, I. Consequently, \nPlP,* = I x1 - x2 1, + I Yl - Y, 1, = (x, - x2), + 011 - Y,), \nPlP, = Jbl - x2I2 + b1 - Y,), whence \n[Equation (2.1) is called the distance formula.] The reader should check that this formula also holds \nwhen P, and P, lie on the same horizontal line or on the same vertical line. \n(2.1) \n10 COORDINATE SYSTEMS IN A PLANE [CHAP. 2 \n1\u2019 \nI I \nI I \nI I \nX \nFig. 2-5 \nY \nI I I \nI I I \nI I I \nX X \nFig. 2-6 \nEXAMPLES \n(a) The distance between (3, 8) and (7, 11) is \nJ(3 - 7)\u2019 + (8 - 11)\u2019 = ,/(-4)\u2019 + (-3)\u2019 = JW = JZ = 5 \n(b) The distance between (4, - 3) and (2,7) is \n,/(4 - 2)\u2019 + (-3 - 7)\u2019 = Jm = ,/- = @ \n= JGZ = J2* fi = 2fi \nALGEBRA For any positive numbers U and U, ,/& = fi &, since (A fi)2 = (&)\u2019(&)\u2019 = uu. \n(c) The distance between any point (a, b) and the origin (0,O) is Jm. \n2.3 THE MIDPOINT FORMULAS \nAgain considering two arbitrary points Pl(xl, y,) and P2(x2, y2), we shall find the coordinates (x, y) \nof the midpoint M of the segment P,P2 (Fig. 2-6). Let A, B, C be the perpendicular projections of P,, \nM, P2 on the x-axis. The x-coordinates of A, B, C are x,, x, x2, respectively. -- Since the lines P,A, MB, \nand P2 C are parallel, the ratios P1M/MP2 and B/BC are equal. But P,M = MP,; hence AB = E. \nSince AB = x - x1 and \n-- \n= x2 - x, \nx - x1= x2 - x \n2x = XI + x2 \nx1 +x2 \n2 \nx=- \n(The same result is obtained when P2 is to the left of P,, in which case AB = x1 - x and = x - x2.) \nSimilarly, y = (yl + y2)/2. Thus, the coordinates of the midpoint M are determined by the midpoint \nformulas \nYl +Y2 and y=- x1+ x2 x=- \n2 2 \nIn words, the coordinates of the midpoint are the averages of the coordinates of the endpoints. \nCHAP. 21 COORDINATE SYSTEMS IN A PLANE 11 \nEXAMPLES \n(a) The midpoint of the segment connecting (1, 7) and (3, 5) is (F, y) = (2,6). \n- (b) The point halfway between ( - 2, 5) and (3, 3) is (*, =) - - (i ,4). \n2 2 \nSolved Problems \n2.1 Determine whether the triangle with vertices A( - 1,2), B(4, 7), C( -3,6) is isosceles. \n- AB = J(-1 - 4)2 +(2 - 7)2 = J(-5)2 +(-5)2 = ,/ET% = Jso \nAC = J[ - 1 - ( -3)12 + (2 - 6)2 = Jw' = JGZ = JZ \nBC = J[4 - (-3)]' + (7 - 6)2 = J7T+1z = JZGT = Jso \n- \n- \nSince AB = E, the triangle is isosceles. \n2.2 Determine whether the triangle with vertices A( - 5, - 3), B( - 7, 3), C(2,6) is a right triangle. \nUse (2.2) to find the squares of the sides, \n- AB2 = (-5 + 7)2 + (-3 - 3)2 = 22 + (-6)2 = 4 + 36 = 40 \nBC2 = (-7 - 2)2 + (3 - 6)2 = 81 + 9 = 90 \nAC2 = (-5 - 2)2 + (-3 - 6)2 = 49 + 81 = 130 \n- \n- \nSince AB2 + m2 = E2, AABC is a right triangle with right angle at B. \nGEOMETRY The converse of the Pythagorean theorem is also true: If x2 = AB2 + m2 in AABC, then \n<ABC is a right angle. \n2.3 Prove by use of coordinates that the midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equidistant \nfrom the three vertices. \nLet the origin of a coordinate system be located at the right angle C; let the positive x-axis contain leg \nCA and the positive y-axis leg CB [see Fig. 2-7(a)]. \nVertex A has coordinates (b, 0), where b = CA; and vertex B has coordinates (0, a), where a = E.

The slope measures the \u201csteepness\u201d of 9. It is the ratio of the change y, - y, \nin the y-coordinate to the change x2 - x, in the x-coordinate. This is equal to the ratio RPz/P,R in \nFig. 4l(a). \n-- \nFig. 4-1 \nY Y \nNotice that the value m of the slope does not depend on the pair of points P,, P, selected. If \nanother pair P3(x3, y3) and P4(x4, y4) is chosen, the same value of m is obtained. In fact, in Fig. 4-l(b), \nAP, P4 S is similar to M1P2 R. \nommy The angles at R and S are both right angles, and the angles at PI and P, are equal because they are \ncorresponding angles determined by the line 9 cutting the parallel lines P,R and P, S. Hence, AP, P, S is similar \nto M,P, R because two angles of the first triangle are equal to two corresponding angles of the second triangle. \nConsequently, since the corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional, \n-- \nY2 -Y, - Y4-Y3 \nP,R P,S xz-x, x4-xg \nRP, SP, --- Or --- --- \nthat is, the slope determined from Pi and Pz is the same as the slope determined from P, and PI. \n24 \nCHAP. 41 STRAIGHT LINES 25 \nEXAMPLE In Fig. 4-2, the slope of the line connecting the points (1,2) and (3, 5) is \n5-2 3 \n3-1 2 1.5 -=-= \nNotice that as a point on the line moves two units to the right, it moves three units upward.

Let us see what the sign of the slope indicates. \nConsider a line 9 that extends upward as it extends to the right. From Fig. 4-3(a), we see that \ny2 > y,; hence, y, - y, > 0. In addition, x2 > x, and, therefore, x2 - x, > 0. Thus, \nm=- Y2 - Yl ,o \nx2 - x1 \nThe slope of 9 is positive. \nConsider a line 9\u2019 that extends downward as it extends to the right. From Fig. 4-3(b), we see that \ny, < y,; therefore, y, - y, < 0. But x2 > x,, so x2 - x, > 0. Hence, \nY2 - Y, < 0 m=- \n*2 - x1 \nThe slope of 9 is negative. \nConsider a horizontal line 9. From Fig. 4-3(c), y, = y, and, therefore, y, - y, = 0. Since x2 > x,, \nx2 - x, > 0. Hence, \nOO Y2 -Y, \nx, -x, x, -x, \nThe slope of 9 is zero. \nConsider a vertical line 9. From Fig. 4-3(4, y2 > y,, so that y, - y, > 0. But x2 = x,, so that \nx2 - x, = 0. Hence, the expression \nm=-=-= \nY, - Yl \nx2 - x1 \nis undefined. The concept of slope is not defined for 9. (Sometimes we express this situation by \nsaying that the slope of 9 is infinite.) \n26 STRAIGHT LINES [CHAP. 4 \nf\u2019 \n(4 \nFig. 4-3 \nNow let us see how the slope varies with the \u201csteepness\u201d of the line. First let us consider lines with \npositive slopes, passing through a fixed point P,(x,, yJ. One such line is shown in Fig. 4-4. Take \nanother point, P2(x2, y,), on A? such that x2 - x1 = 1. Then, by definition, the slope rn is equal to the \ndistance RP, . Now as the steepness of the line increases, RP, increases without limit [see Fig. 4-5(a)J. \nThus, the slope of 9 increases from 0 (when 9 is horizontal) to + CO (when 9 is vertical). By a similar \nconstruction we can show that as a negatively sloped line becomes steeper and steeper, the slope stead- \nily decreases from 0 (when the line is horizontal) to - CQ (when the line is vertical) [see Fig. 4-5(b)]. \n- - \nt\u2019 Y \nFig. 44 \nCHAP. 41 STRAIGHT LINES \n4Y \nm =O m =O \n27 \n(a 1 \nFig. 4-5 \n4.2 EQUATIONS OF A LINE \nConsider a line 9\u2019 that passes through the point P,(x,, y,) and has slope rn [Fig. 4-6(a)]. For any \nother point P(x, y) on the line, the slope rn is, by definition, the ratio of y - y, to x - xl. Hence, \nOn the other hand, if P(x, y) is not on line 9 [Fig. 4-6(b)], then the slope (y - y,)/(x - x,) of the line \nPP, is different from the slope rn of 9, so that (4.1) does not hold. Equation (4.1) can be rewritten as \nNote that (4.2) is also satisfied by the point (x,, y,). So a point (x, y) is on line 14 if and only if it satisfies \n(4.2); that is, 9 is the graph of (4.2). Equation (4.2) is called a point-slope equation of the line 9. \ntY \nc \nX \ntY \nX \nEXAMPLES \n(U) A point-slope equation of the line going through the point (1,3) with slope 5 is \n(b) Let 9 be the line through the points (1,4) and (- 1,2). The slope of 9 is \ny - 3 = 5(x - 1) \n21 4-2 m=-=-= \n1-(-1) 2 \n28 STRAIGHT LINES [CHAP. 4 \nTherefore, two point-slope equations of 9 are \nY-4-x-1 and y-2=~+1 \nEquation (4.2) is equivalent to \ny-y, =mx-mx, or y=mx+(y, -mx,) \nLet b stand for the number y, - mx,. Then the equation becomes \ny=mx+b (4.3) \nWhen x = 0, (4.3) yields the value y = b. Hence, the point (0, b) lies on 9. Thus, b is the y-coordinate of \nthe point where 9 intersects the y-axis (see Fig. 4-7). The number b is called the y-intercept of 9, and \n(4.3) is called the slope-intercept equation of 9. \n4Y \nY \n* \nX \nFig. 4-7 \nEXAMPLE Let 14 be the line through points (1,3) and (2, 5). Its slope m is \n5-3 2 -- --=2 \n2-1 1 \nIts slope-intercept equation must have the form y = 2x + b. Since the point (1, 3) is on line 14, (1,3) must satisfy the \nequation \n3 = 2(1) + b \nSo, b = 1, giving y = 2x + 1 as the slope-intercept equation. \nAn alternative method is to write down a point-slope equation, \nwhence, \ny - 3 = 2(x - 1) \ny - 3 = 2x - 2 \ny=2x+1 \n43 PARALLEL LINES \nAssume that 9, and 9, are parallel, nonvertical lines, and let P, and P, be the points where 2Yl \nand 9, cut the y-axis [see Fig. 4-8(u)]. Let R, be one unit to the right of P,, and R, one unit to the \nright of P,. Let Q, and Q2 be the intersections of the vertical lines through RI and R2 with 2Yl and \nY2.

SRI = SR, since both are right angles, \n- P1R-,=P2R2=1 \n< P1 = % P, , since S P, and < P, are formed by pairs of parallel lines. \nCHAP. 41 \nAY \nSTRAIGHT LINES \nt\u2019 \n29 \nFig. 4-8 \n-- \nHence, RIQl = R2 Q2, and \n-- \nslope of Yl = - RIQ1 - - - R2Q2 - - slope of 92 \n1 1 \nThus, parallel lines have equal slopes. \nConversely, if different lines Yl and Y2 are not parallel, then their slopes must be different. For if \nYl and 9, meet at the point P [see Fig. 4-8(b)] and if their slopes are the same, then Yl and Y2 \nwould have to be the same line. Thus, we have proved: \nTheorem 4.1: Two distinct lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal. \nEXAMPLE Let us find an equation of the line 9 through (3, 2) and parallel to the line A having the equation \n3x - y = 2. The line A has slope-intercept equation y = 3x + 2. Hence, the slope of A is 3, and the slope of the \nparallel line 9 also must be 3. The slope-intercept equation of 9 must then be of the form y = 3x + b. Since (3, 2) \nlies on 9, 2 = 3(3) + b, or b = -7. Thus, the slope-intercept equation of 9 is y = 3x - 7. An equivalent equation \nis 3x - y = 7. \n4.4 PERPENDICULAR LINES \nTheorem 4.2: Two nonvertical lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is - 1. \nHence, if the slope of one of the lines\u2019is rn, then the slope of the other line is the negative \nreciprocal - l/m. \nFor a proof, see Problem 4.5. \n4.1 Find the slope of the line having the equation 5x - 2y = 4.

The line goes through the \npoint (0, -2). To draw the line, we need another point on the line. Substitute 2 for x in (I), obtaining y = 3. \nHence, (2, 3) is a point on the line (see Fig. 4-9). (We could have found other points on the line by substitut- \ning numbers other than 2 for x.) To test whether (10, 23) is on the line, substitute 10 for x and 23 for y and \nsee whether the equation 5x - 2y = 4 holds. The two sides turn out to be equal; so (10, 23) is on the line.

Let R be the point on 9f with x-coordinate 1, and let Q be the point on 93 with x-coordinate \n1 [see Fig. 4-12(b)]. The slope-intercept equation of 14: is y = mlx, and so the y-coordinate of R is m, since \nits x-coordinate is 1. Similarly, the y-coordinate of Q is m, .

For example, the volume V of a cube is a function of the length s \nof a side. In fact, the dependence of V on s can be made precise through the formula V = s3. Such a \nspecific association of a number s3 with a given number s is what mathematicians usually mean by a \nfunction. \nIn Fig. 7-1, we picture a functionfas some sort of process which, from a number x, produces a \nnumberf(x); the number x is called an argument off and the numberf(x) is called the value off for the \nargument x. \nEXAMPLES \n(a) The square-root function associates with each nonnegative real number x the value &; that is, the unique \nnonnegative real number y such that y2 = x. \n(b) The doubling function g associates with each real number x the value 2x. Thus, g(3) = 6, \ng( - 1) = -2, g(&) = 2a. \nThe graph of a functionfconsists of all points (x, y) such that y =f(x). Thus, the graph off is the \ngraph of the equation y =f(x). \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Consider the functionfsuch thatf(x) = x + 1 for all x. The graph off is the set of all points (x, y) such that \ny = x + 1. This is a straight line, with slope 1 and y-intercept 1 (see Fig. 7-2). \n(b) The graph of the functionfsuch thatf(x) = x2 for all x consists of all points (x, y) such that y = x2. This is the \nparabola of Fig. 3-2. \n(c) Consider the function f such that f(x) = x3 for all x. In Fig. 7-3(a), we have indicated a few points on the \ngraph, which is sketched in Fig. 7-3(b). \nThe numbers x for which a functionfproduces a valuef(x) form a collection of numbers, called the \ndomain off. For example, the domain of the square-root function consists of all nonnegative real \nOUTPUT INPUT NNCnON \n(argument) (value) \nf (x) - \nFig. 7-1 Fig. 7-2 \n46 \nCHAP. 71 FUNCTIONS AND THEIR GRAPHS \n2718 \nAY \n(4 \nFig. 7-3 \n47 \nnumbers; the function is not defined for negative arguments. On the other hand, the domain of the \ndoubling function consists of all real numbers. \nThe numbers that are the values of a function form the range of the function. \nThe domain and the range of a functionfoften can be determined easily by looking at the graph \noffi The domain consists of all x-coordinates of points of the graph, and the range consists of all \ny-coordinates of points of the graph. \nEXAMPLES \n(U) The range of the square-root function consists of all nonnegative real numbers. Indeed, for every nonnegative \nreal number y there is some number x such that & = y; namely, the number y2. \n(b) The range of the doubling function consists of all real numbers. Indeed, for every real number y there exists a \nreal number x such that 2x = y; namely, the number y/2. \n(c) Consider the absolute-value function h, defined by h(x) = I x I. The domain consists of all real numbers, but the \nrange is made up of all nonnegative real numbers. The graph is shown in Fig. 7-4. When x 2 0, y = I xl is \nequivalent to y = x, the equation of the straight line through the origin with slope 1. When x < 0, y = I x I is \nequivalent to y = -x, the equation of the straight line through the origin with slope - 1. The perpendicular \nprojection of all points of the graph onto the y-axis shows that the range consists of all y such that y 2 0. \nbY \nFig. 7-4 \n(d) Consider the function g defined by the formula g(x) = ,/=, whenever this formula makes sense. Here the \nvalue ,/= is defined only when 1 - x 2 0; that is, only when x _< 1. So the domain of g consists of all real \nnumbers x such that x I 1. It is a little harder to find the range of g. Consider a real number y; it will belong \nto the range of g if we can find some number x such that y = ,/=. Since ,/= cannot be negative \n(by definition of the square-root function), we must restrict our attention to nonnegative y. Now if \n48 FUNCTIONS AND THEIR GRAPHS \n1 \n0 \n-1 \n-2 \n-3 \n[CHAP. 7 \n0 \n1 \nfi 5 1.4 \nfi z 1.7 \n2 \ny = ,/=, then y2 = 1 - x, and, therefore, x = 1 - y2. Indeed, when x = 1 - y2, then \nThe range of g therefore consists of all nonnegative real numbers. This is clear from the graph of g [see Fig. \n7-5(b)]. The graph is the upper half of the parabola x = 1 - y2. \ntY \n-1 \\ \n-\u2019 OI \n-3 -2 1 X \n(e) A function can be defined \u201cby cases.\u201d For instance, \nx2 ifx<o \nl+x if0sxsl \nHere the valuef(x) is determined by two different formulas.

This can be seen from Fig. 7-6, in which projection of the graph onto the y-axis \nproduces all y such that y > 0. . \n1 I 1) \nX \nFig. 7-6 \nNote: In many treatments of the foundations of mathematics, a function is identified with its graph. In \nother words, a function is defined to be a setfof ordered pairs such thatfdoes not contain two pairs \n(a, b) and (a, c) with b # c. Then \u201cy =j(x))\u2019 is defined to mean the same thing as \u201c(x, y) belongs to 5\u2019\u2019 \nHowever, this approach obscures the intuitive idea of a function. \n7.2 INTERVALS \nconvenient to introduce special notation and terminology for them. \nIn dealing with the domains and ranges of functions, intervals of numbers occur so often that it is \nCHAP. 73 FUNCTIONS AND THEIR GRAPHS 49 \nClosed intend: [a, b] consists of all numbers x such that a 5 x 5 b. \nThe solid dots on the line at a and b means that a and b are included in the closed interval [a, b]. \na b \nOpen intend: (a, b) consists of all numbers x such that a < x < b. \nThe open dots on the line at a and b indicate that the endpoints a and b are not included in the open \ninterval (a, b). \na b \nn n W \nHdf+pen intervals: [a, b) consists of all numbers x such that a 5 x < b. \na b \n(a, b] consists of all numbers x such that a < x s b. \nEXAMPLE Consider the functionfsuch thatf(x) = ,/=, whenever this formula makes sense. The domain off \nconsists of all numbers x such that \n1-x220 or x\u201911 or -ISXS~ \nThus, the domain off is the closed interval [ - 1, 13. To determine the range off; notice that as x varies from - 1 to \n0, x2 varies from 1 to 0, 1 - x2 varies from 0 to 1, and ,/= also varies from 0 to 1. Similarly, as x varies from 0 \nto 1, ,/= varies from 1 to 0. Hence, the range offis the closed interval [0, 13. This is confirmed by looking at \nthe graph of the equation y = ,/= in Fig. 7-7. This is a semicircle. In fact, the circle x2 + y2 = 1 is equivalent \nto \ny2 = 1 - x2 or y = +JC7 \nThe value of the functionfcorresponds to the choice of the + sign and gives the upper half of the circle. \n-1 \nOI \nFig. 7-7 \n50 FUNCTIONS AND THEIR GRAPHS [CHAP. 7 \nSometimes we deal with intervals that are unbounded on one side. \n[a, CO) is made up of all x such that U 5 x. \na \n(a, 00) is made up of all x such that a < x. \na \nn \nV b \n(- CO, b] is made up of all x such that x 5 b. \nb \n( - CO, b) is made up of all x such that x < b. \nn \nV \nEXAMPLE The range of the function graphed in Fig. 7-6 is (0, CO).

Then \nf( -x) = (-Xy = x2 =f(x) \nand so f is even. \n(b) Letf(x) = 3x4 - 5x2 + 2 for all x. Then \nf(-x) = 3(-x)4 - 5(-Xy + 2 = 3x4 - 5x2 + 2 =f(x) \nThus, f is even. More generally, a function that is defined for all x and involves only even powers of x is an \neven function. \n(c) Letf(x) = x3 + 1 for all x.

For the \nsymmetry means that for any point (x,~(x)) on the graph, the image point (-x, -f(x)) is also on the \ngraph; that is,f( - x) = -f(x) (see Fig. 7-9). \n7.4 ALGEBRA REVIEW: ZEROS OF POLYNOMIALS \nFunctions defined by polynomials are so important in calculus that it is essential to review certain \nbasic facts concerning polynomials. \nDefinition: For any functionf, a zero or root offis a number r such thatf(r) = 0. \n52 FUNCTIONS AND THEIR GRAPHS [CHAP. 7 \nEXAMPLES \n(a) 3 is a root of the polynomial 2x3 - 4x2 - 8x + 6, since \n2(3)3 - 4(3)2 - 8(3) + 6 = 2(27) - 4(9) - 24 + 6 = 54 - 36 - 24 + 6 = 0 \nX' - 2~ - 15 \nx+2 (6) 5 is a zero of because \n(5)2 - 2(5) - 15 25 - 10 - 15 0 \n5+2 7 7 \n- - -0 --= \nTheorem 7.1: If f(x) = a, x\" + a,- lx\"- + + a,x + a, is a polynomial with integral coefficients \n(that is, the numbers a,,, a,,-,, . . . , a,, a, are integers), and if r is an integer that is a root \noff, then r must be a divisor of the constant term a,. \nEXAMPLE By Theorem 7.1, any integral root of x3 - 2x2 - 5x + 6 must be among the divisors of 6, which are \nf 1, f 2, f 3, and f 6. By actual substitution, it is found that 1, - 2, and 3 are roots. \nTheorem 7.2: A number r is a root of the polynomial \nf(x) = a,x\" + a,-,xn-~ + *** + a,x + a0 \nif and only iff(x) is divisible by the polynomial x - r. \nEXAMPLES \nConsider the polynomialf(x) = x3 - 4x2 + 14x - 20. By Theorem 7.1, any integral root must be a divisor of \n20; that is, f 1, f 2, f 4, f 5, f 10, or 20. Calculation reveals that 2 is a root. Hence (Theorem 7.2), x - 2 \nmust divide f(x); we carry out the division in Fig. 7-1qa). Since f(x) = (x - 2)(x2 - 2x + lO), its remaining \nroots are found by solving \nx2 - 2x + 10 = 0 \nApplying the quadratic formula (see Problem 5.2), \nThus, the other two roots off(x) are the complex numbers 1 + 3- and 1 - 3n. \nLet us find the roots of f(x) = x3 - 5x2 + 3x + 9. The integral roots (if any) must be divisors of 9: f 1, +, 3, \nf9. 1 is not a root, but - 1 is a root. Hencef(x) is divisible by x + 1 [see Fig. 7-1qb)l. The other roots off(x) \nmust be the roots of x2 - 6x + 9. But x2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)2. Thus, - 1 and 3 are the roots off(x); 3 is called \na repeated root because (x - 3)' is a factor of x3 - 5x2 + 3x + 9. \nxz - 2x + 10 \nx3 - 2x2 \nx - 2 I x3 - 4x2 + 14x - 20 \n- 2x2 + 14~ \n- 2x2 + 4x \n1ox - 20 \n1ox - 20 \nx2 -6~ +9 \nx3 + x2 \nx+ 1 )x3-5x*+3x+9 \n- 6x2 + 3~ \n- 6x2 - 6~ \n9x + 9 \n9x + 9 \nTheorem 7.3: (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra): If repeated roots are counted multiply, then every \npolynomial of degree n has exactly n roots. \nCHAP. 71 FUNCTIONS AND THEIR GRAPHS 53 \nEXAMPLE In example (b) above, the polynomial x3 - 5x2 + 3x + 9 of degree 3 has two roots, - 1 and 3, but 3 is \na repeated root of multiplicity 2 and, therefore, is counted twice. \nSince the complex roots of a polynomial with real coefficients occur in pairs, a f bn, the poly- \nnomial can have only an even number (possibly zero) of complex roots. Hence, a polynomial of odd \ndegree must have at least one real root. \nSolved Problems \n7.1 Find the domain and the range of the functionfsuch thatf(x) = -x2. \nSince -x2 is defined for every real number x, the domain offconsists of all real numbers. To find the \nrange, notice that x2 2 0 for all x and, therefore, -x2 I 0 for all x. Every non ositive number y appears as \na value -xz for a suitable argument x; namely, for the argument x = &(and also for the argument \nx = -A). Thus the range off is (- 00, 01. This can be seen more easily by looking at the graph of \ny = -x2 [see Fig. 7-11(u)]. \ntY AY \n-I 0 1 X \nFig. 7-11 \n7.2 Find the domain and the range of the functionfdefined by \nThe domain off consists of all x such that either - 1 < x < 0 or 0 I x < 1.

The range off is easily found from the graph in Fig. 7-1 l(b), whose projection onto the \ny-axis is the half-open interval [0, 1). \n7.3 Definef(x) as the greatest integer less than or equal to x; this value is usually denoted by [x]. \nFind the domain and the range, and draw the graph off: \nSince [x] is defined for all x, the domain is the set of all real numbers.

It will be necessary \nto see how the valuef(x) of a functionfbehaves as the argument x approaches a given number. This \nleads to the idea of limit. \nEXAMPLE Consider the function fsuch that \nwhenever this formula makes sense. Thus,fis defined for all x for which the denominator x - 3 is not 0; that is, for \nx # 3. What happens to the value f(x) as x approaches 3? Well, x2 approaches 9, and so x2 - 9 approaches 0; \nmoreover, x - 3 approaches 0. Since the numerator and the denominator both approach 0, it is not clear what \nx2 -9 happens to - x-3\u2019 \nHowever, upon factoring the numerator, we observe that \nx2 - 9 \nx-3 x-3 \n(X - 3)(x + 3) =x+3 -- - \nSince x + 3 unquestionably approaches 6 as x approaches 3, we now know that our function approaches 6 as x \napproaches 3. The traditional mathematical way of expressing this fact is \nx2 - 9 lim - - -6 \nx+3 x-3 \nx2 - 9 \nx-3 This is read: \u201cThe limit of - as x approaches 3 is 6.\u201d \napproaches 4, x2 - 9 approaches 7 and x - 3 approaches 1. Hence, \nNotice that there is no problem when x approaches any number other than 3. For instance, when x \nx2-9 7 lim - --=7 - \nx+4 x-3 1 \n8.2 PROPERTIES OF LIMITS \nIn the foregoing example we assumed without explicit mention certain obvious properties of the \nnotion of limit. Let us write them down explicitly. \nPROPERTY I. \nlimx=a \nx-ra \nThis follows directly from the meaning of the limit concept. \nPROPERTY 11. If c is a constant, \nlim c = c \nx+a \nAs x approaches a, the value of c remains c. \n59 \n60 LIMITS [CHAP. 8 \nPROPERTY 111. If c is a constant andfis a function, \nlim c .f(x) = c limf(x) \nx+a x+a \nEXAMPLE \nlim 5x = 5 lim x = 5 3 = 15 \nx43 x+ 3 \nlim - x = lim (- 1)x = (- 1) lim x = (-1) 3 = -3 \nX'3 x-3 x-3 \nPROPERTY IV. Iffand g are functions, \nlim [f(x) g(x)] = lim f(x) lim g(x) \nx+a x+a x+a \nThe limit of a product is the product of the limits. \nEXAMPLE \nlim x2 = lim x lim x = a a = u2 \nX'O X'O X'O \nMore generally, for any positive integer n, lim x\" = U\". \nx+o \nPROPERTY V. Iffand g are functions, \nlim [f(x) g(x)] = limf(x) & lim g(x) \nx+a x+a x+a \nThe limit of a sum (diflerence) is the sum (diflerence) of the limits. \nEXAMPLES \n(4 Iim (3x2 + 5x) = lim 3x2 + lim 5x \nx-2 X'2 x-2 \n= 3 lim x2 + 5 lim x = 3(2)2 + 5(2) = 22 \nx-2 x-2 \n(b) More generally, if f(x) = a,P + a,- lxn-l + - - - + u0 is any polynomial function and k is any real number, \nthen \nlimf(x) = a,k\" + u,-lk\"-l + + a, =f(k) \nx+k \nPROPERTY VI. If f and g are functions and lim g(x) # 0, then \nx+a \nx +a \nThe limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits. \nEXAMPLE \nlim (2x3 - 5) 2(4)3 - 5 123 =-=- 22 -5 x+4 \nlim - = \nx+4 3x + 2 lim (3x + 2) 3(4) + 2 14 \nx+4 \nPROPERTY VII. \nlim ,,&j = ,/m \nx+a x -+a \nThe limit of a square root is the square root of the limit. \nCHAP. 81 LIMITS 61 \nEXAMPLE \nlim ,/- = dm = fi = 3 \nx-42 x+2 \nProperties IV-VII have a common structure. Each tells us that, providedfand/or g has a limit as x \napproaches a (see Section 8.3), another, related function also has a limit as x approaches a, and this \nlimit is as given by the indicated formula. \n83 EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE OF THE LIMIT \nIn certain cases, a functionf(x) will not approach a limit as x approaches a particular number. \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Figure 8-l(a) indicates that \n1 lim - \nx-ro x \ndoes not exist. As x approaches 0, the magnitude of l/x becomes larger and larger. (If x > 0, l/x is positive and \nvery large when x is close to 0. If x < 0, l/x is negative and very \u201csmall\u201d when x is close to 0.) \n(b) Figure 8-l(b) indicates that \n1x1 lim - \nx-ro x \ndoes not exist. When x>O, 1x1 =x and IxI/x= 1; when x<O, 1x1 = -x and IxI/x= -1. Thus, as x \napproaches 0, IxI/x approaches two different values, 1 and -1, depending on whether x nears 0 through \npositive or through negative values. Since there is no unique limit as x approaches 0, we say that \n1x1 lim - \nx-ro x \ndoes not exist. \n(4 Let \nThen [see Fig. 8-l(c)], limf(x) does not exist. As x approaches 1 from the left (that is, through values of x < l), \nf(x) approaches 1. But as x approaches 1 from the right (that is, through values of x > l),f(x) approaches 2. \nx-r 1 \n(4 \nFig. 8-1 \n62 LIMITS [CHAP. 8 \nNotice that the existence or nonexistence of a limit for f(x) as x 4 a does not depend on the value \nf(a), nor is it even required that f be defined at a. If lirn f(x) = L, then L is a number to which f(x) can \nbe made arbitrarily close by letting x be sufliciently close to a. The value of L-or the very existence of \nL-is determined by the behavior offnear a, not by its value at a (if such a value even exists). \nx+a \nSolved Problems \n8.1 Find the following limits (if they exist): \n(a) Both y2 and l/y have limits as y + 2. So, by Property V, \n(b) Here it is necessary to proceed indirectly. The function x2 has a limit as x + 0. Hence, supposing the \nindicated limit to exist, Property V implies that \nlim [x' - (x2 - 91 = lim - 1 \nx-0 x+o x \nalso exists. But that is not the case. [See example (a) in Section 8.3.1 Hence, \nlim (x2 - i) \nx-0 \ndoes not exist. \nu2 - 25 (U - 5XU + 5) lim - - - lim = lim (U + 5) = 10 \n\"-5 U-5 \"+5 U-5 U45 \n(d) As x approaches 2 from the right (that is, with x > 2), [x] remains equal to 2 (see Fig. 7-12).

A mathematically precise version of this assertion is: For any real number E > 0, there exists \na real number 6 > 0 such that \n0 < Ix - a1 < 6 implies If(x) - LI c E \nfor any x in the domain off. Remember that I x - a I < 6 means that the distance between x and a is \nsmaller than 6, and that I f(x) - L I < E means that the distance between f(x) and L is smaller than E. \nWe assume that the domain off is such that it contains at least one argument x within distance 6 of a \nfor arbitrary 6 > 0. Observe also that the condition 0 < I x - a I excludes consideration of x = a, in line \nwith the requirement that the value (if any) off@) has nothing to do with limf(x). \nA pictorial version of this definition is shown in Fig. 8-2. No matter how thin a horizontal strip (of \nwidth 24 that may be taken symmetrically above and below the line y = L, there is a thin vertical strip \n(of width 26) around the line x = a such that, for any x-coordinate of a point in this strip except x = a, \nthe corresponding point (x,f(x)) lies in the @ven horizontal strip. The number 6 depends on the given \nnumber E; if is made smaller, then 6 may also have to be chosen smaller. \nThe precise version just given for the limit concept is called an epsilon-delta definition because of \nthe traditional use of the Greek letters 6 and 6. \n(b) Let E > 0 be given.

More precisely, f achieves a relative maximum at c if there exists 6 > 0 such that \nI x - c I -c 6 impliesf(x) <f(c). \nEXAMPLE For the function f whose graph is shown in Fig. 14-1, relative maxima occur at x = c1 and x = c2. \nThis is obvious, since the point A is higher than nearby points on the graph, and the point B is higher than nearby \npoints on the graph. \nThe word \u201crelative\u201d is used to modify \u201cmaximum\u201d because the value of a function at a relative maximum is \nnot necessarily the greatest value of the function. Thus, in Fig. 14-1, the valuef(c,) at c1 is smaller than many other \nvalues off@); in particular,f(c,) <f(c2). In this example, the valuef(c,) is the greatest value of the function. \nA functionfis said to have a relative minimum at x = c if \nf (4 2 f (4 \nfor x near c. In Fig. 14-1,fachieves a relative minimum at x = d, since point D is lower than nearby \npoints on the graph. The value at a relative minimum need not be the smallest value of the function; for \nexample, in Fig. 14-1, the valuef(e) is smaller thanf(d). \nBy a relative extrernum is meant either a relative maximum or a relative minimum. Points at which \na relative extremum exists possess the following characteristic property. \nty B \nFig. 14-1 \nTheorem 14.1: Iffhas a relative extremum at x = c and iff\u2019(c) exists, thenf\u2019(c) = 0. \nThe theorem is intuitively obvious. Iff\u2019(c) exists, then there is a well-defined tangent line at the \npoint on the graph offwhere x = c. But at a relative maximum or relative minimum, the tangent line is \nhorizontal (see Fig. 14-2), and so its slopef\u2019(c) is zero. For a rigorous proof, see Problem 14.28. \nThe converse of Theorem 14.1 does not hold. Iff\u2019(c) = 0, thenfneed not have a relative extremum \nat x = c. \n104 \nCHAP. 14) MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM PROBLEMS 105 \nAY \n2- \n1- \nI * \nI 2 X \nFig. 14-2 Fig. 14-3 \nEXAMPLE Consider the functionf(x) = x3.

But from the graph \noffin Fig. 14-3 it is clear thatfhas neither a relative maximum nor a relative minimum at x = 0. \nIn Chapter 23, a method will be given that often will enable us to determine whether a relative \nextremum actually exists whenf\u2019(c) = 0. \n14.2 ABSOLUTE EXTREMA \nPractical applications usually call for finding the absolute maximum or absolute minimum of a \nfunction on a given set. Letfbe a function defined on a set d (and possibly at other points, too), and let \nc belong to b. Then f is said to achieve an absolute maximum on Q at c if f(x) <f(c) for all x in b. \nSimilarly,fis said to achieve an absolute minimum on E at d iff(x) >f(d) for all x in 8. \nIf the set d is a closed interval [a, b], and if the functionfis continuous over [a, b] (see Section \n10.3), then we have a very important existence theorem (which cannot be proved in an elementary way). \nTheorem 14.2 (Extreme-Value Theorem): Any continuous function f over a closed interval [a, b] has \nan absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on [a, b]. \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Letf(x) = x + 1 for all x in the closed interval [0, 21. The graph offis shown in Fig. 14-*a). Thenfachieves \nan absolute maximum on CO, 2) at x = 2; this absolute maximum value is 3. In additionJachieves an absolute \nminimum at x = 0; this absolute minimum value is 1. \n(b) Let f(x) = l/x for all x in the open interval (0, 1). The graph off is shown in Fig. 14-4(b). f has neither an \nabsolute maximum nor an absolute minimum on (0, 1). If we extended f to the half-open interval (0, 11, then \nthere is an absolute minimum at x = 1, but still no absolute maximum. \nx+l if-l<x<O \nifx=O \nIo x-1 ifO<x<l \n(4 ktf(x) = \nSee Fig. 14-q~) for the graph off: f has neither an absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum on the \nclosed interval [- 1, 13. Theorem 14.2 does not apply, becausefis discontinuous at 0. \nCritical Numbers \nTo actually locate the absolute extrema guaranteed by Theorem 14.2, it is useful to have the follow- \ning notion. \n106 MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM PROBLEMS [CHAP. 14 \n(6) \nFig. 14-4 \nDefinition: A critical number of a functionfis a number c in the domain off for which eitherf\u2019(c) = 0 \norf\u2019(c) is not defined. \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Let f(x) = 3x2 - 2x + 4. Then f\u2018(x) = 6x - 2. Since 6x - 2 is defined for all x, the only critical numbers are \ngiven by \n6~-2=0 \n6x = 2 \nX=$=i \nThus, the only critical number is 3. \n(b) Letf(x) = x3 - x2 - 5x + 3. Thenf\u2019(x) = 3x2 - 2x - 5, and since 3x2 - 2x - 5 is defined for all x, the only \ncritical numbers are the solutions of \n3x2 - 2x - 5 = 0 \n(3x - 5)(x + 1) = 0 \n3x-5=0 or x+1=0 \n3x = 5 or x= -1 \nx=3 or x- -1 \nHence, there are two critical numbers, - 1 and 3. \nWe already know from the example in Section 13,l that f\u2019(0) is not defined. Hence, 0 is a critical number. \nSince D,(x) = 1 and DA -x) = - 1, there are no other critical numbers. \nMethod for Finding Absolute Extrema \nLet f be a continuous function on a closed interval [a, b]. Assume that there are only a finite \nnumber of critical numbers c1, c2, . . . , ck off inside [a, b]; that is, in (a, b). (This assumption holds for \nmost functions encountered in calculus.) Tabulate the values off at these critical numbers and at the \nendpoints U and b, as in Table 14-1. Then the largest tabulated value is the absolute maximum off on \n[a, b], and the smallest tabulated value is the absolute minimum off on [a, b].

Consider, for instance, an automobile moving \nalong a straight road. We can imagine a coordinate system imposed on the line containing the road (see \nFig. 18-1). (On many highways there actually is such a coordinate system, with markers along the side \nof the road indicating the distance from one end of the highway.) Ifs designates the coordinate of the \nautomobile and t denotes the time, then the motion of the automobile is specified by expressing s, its \nposition, as a function oft: s =f(t). \n1 L 1 I 1 I 1 1 & \n-3-2-1 0 I2 3 4 S \nFig. 18-1 \nThe speedometer indicates how fast the automobile is moving. Since the speedometer reading often \nvaries continuously, it is obvious that the speedometer indicates how fast the car is moving at the \nmoment when it is read. Let us analyze this notion in order to find the mathematical concept that lies \nbehind it. \nIf the automobile moves according to the equation s =f(t), its position at time t isf(t), and at time \nt + h, very close to time t, its position isf(t + h). The distance\u2019 between its position at time t and its \nposition at time t + h isf(t + h) -f(t) (which can be negative). The time elapsed between t and t + h is \nh. Hence, the average velocity2 during this time interval is \nf(t + h) -m \nh \n(Average velocity = displacement - time.) Now as the elapsed time h gets closer to 0, the average veloc- \nity approaches what we intuitively think of as the instantaneous velocity U at time t. Thus, \nv = lim f(t + h) -f(O \nh h-0 \nIn other words, the instantaneous velocity v is the derivative f\u2019(t). \nEXAMPLES \n(a) The height s of a water column is observed to follow the law s =f(t) = 3t + 2. Thus, the instantaneous veloc- \nity U of the top surface isf\u2019(t) = 3. \n(6) The position s of an automobile along a highway is given by s =f(t) = t2 - 2t. Hence, its instantaneous \nvelocity is U =f\u2018(t) = 2t - 2. At time t = 3, its velocity U is 2(3) - 2 = 4. \nThe sign of the instantaneous velocity v indicates the direction in which the object is moving. If \nU = ds/dt > 0 over a time interval, Theorem 17.3 tells us that s is increasing in that interval. Thus, if the \ns-axis is horizontal and directed to the right, as in Fig. 18-2(a), then the object is moving to the right; \nbut if the s-axis is vertical and directed upward, as in Fig. 18-2(b), then the object is moving upward. On \nMore precisely, the displacement, since it can be positive, negative, or zero. \n\u2019 We use the term velocity rather than speed because the quantity referred to can be negative. Speed is defined as the magnitude of \nthe velocity and is never negative. \n136 \nCHAP. 181 RECTILINEAR MOTION AND INSTANTANEOUS \nthe other hand, if U = ds/dt -c 0 over a time interval, then s must be \n137 VELOCITY \ndecreasing in that interval. In \nFig. 18-2(a), the object would be moving to the left (in the direction of decreasing s); in Fig. 18-2(b), the \nobject would be moving downward. \nA consequence of these facts is that at an instant t when a continuously mooing object reverses \ndirection, its instantaneous oelocity o must be 0. For if U were, say, positive at t, it would be positive in a \nsmall interval of time surrounding t; the object would therefore be moving in the same direction just \nbefore and just after t. Or, to say the same thing in a slightly different way, a reversal in direction means \na relative extremum of s, which in turn implies (Theorem 14.1) ds/dt = 0. \n\\ \nEXAMPLE An object moves along a straight line as indicated in Fig. 18-3(a). In functional form, \ns =f(t) = (t + 2)2 [s in meters, t in seconds] \nas graphed in Fig. 18-3(b). The object\u2019s instantaneous velocity is \nt, =f\u2019(t) = 2(t + 2) [meters per second] \nFor t + 2 < 0, or t < -2, o is negative and the object is moving to the left; for t + 2 > 0, or t > -2, t, is positive \nand the object is moving to the right. The object reverses direction at t = -2, and at that instant U = 0.

The ensuing rectilinear motion is called \njiee fall. \nLet us put a coordinate system on the vertical line along which the object moves, such that the \ns-axis is directed upward, away from the earth, with s = 0 located at the surface of the earth (Fig. 18-4). \n138 RECTILINEAR MOTION AND INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY [CHAP. 18 \nFig. 18-4 \nThen the equation of free fall is \ns SO + VO t - 16t2 (18.1) \nwhere s is measured in feet and t in seconds?

When, and with what velocity, \ndoes it strike the ground? \nWith so = 256 and uo = 0, (18.1) becomes s = 256 - 16t2 and the time of striking the ground is given by \nthe solution of \n0 = 256 - 16t2 \n16t2 = 256 \nt2 = 16 \nt = +,4 seconds \nSince we are assuming that the motion takes place when t 2 0, the only solution is t = 4 seconds. \nThe velocity equation (18.2) is U = -32t, and so, for t = 4, \nU = - 32(4) = - 128 feet per second \nthe minus sign indicating that the rock is moving downward when it hits the ground. \nALGEBRA x feet per second = 6Ox feet per minute \n= 60(60x) feet per hour \n=- 3600x miles per hour \n5280 \n15 \n22 = - x miles per hour \nFor example, 128 feet per second = 8 (128) = 876 miles per hour. \n(28.3) \nA rocket is shot vertically from the ground with an initial velocity of 96 feet per second. When does the rocket \nreach its maximum height, and what is its maximum height? \nWith so = 0 and uo = 96, (18.1) and (28.2) become \ndS \ndt s = 96t - 16t2 and U = - = 96 - 32t \nIf the position is measured in meters, the equation reads s = so + uo t - 4.9t2. \nCHAP. 18) RECTILINEAR MOTION AND INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY 139 \nAt a maximum value, qr turning point, U = 0. Hence, \n0 = 96 - 32t \n32t = 96 \nt=3 \nThus, it takes 3 seconds for the rocket to reach its maximum height, which is \ns = 96(3) - 16(3)2 = 288 - 16(9) = 288 - 144 = 144 feet \n(c) When does the rocket of part (b) hit the ground? \nIt suffices to set s = 0 in the free-fall equation (18J), \n0 = 96t - 16t2 \n0 = 6t - t2 [divide by 163 \n0 = t(6 - t) \nfrom which t = 0 or t = 6. Hence, the rocket hits the ground again after 6 seconds. \nNotice that the rocket rose for 3 seconds to its maximum height, and then took 3 more seconds to fall \nback to the ground. In general, the upward flight from point P to point Q will take exactly the same time as \nthe downward flight from Q to P. In addition, the rocket will return to a given height with the same speed \n(magnitude of the velocity) that it had upon leaving that height. \nSolved Problems \n18.1 A stone is thrown straight down from the top of an 80-foot tower. If the initial speed is 64 feet \nper second, how long does it take to hit the ground, and with what speed does it hit the ground? \nHere so = 80 and uo = -64. (The speed is the magnitude of the velocity. The minus sign for uo indi- \ncates that the object is moving downward.) Hence, \nds \ndt s = 80 - 64t - 16t2 and U = - = -64 - 322 \nThe stone hits the ground when s = 0, \n0 = 80 - 64t - 16t2 \n0 = t2 + 4t - 5 \nt+5= 0 or t-1=0 \nt=-5 or t=l \n[divide by -161 \n0 = (t + 5Xt - 1) \nSince the time of fall must be positive, t = 1 second.

When is the car at rest? \nWe have U =f'(t) = 6t2 - 6t - 12 = 6(t2 - t - 2) = 6(t - 2)(t + 1). The key points are t = 2 and \nt = - 1 (see Fig. 18-5). \n-I 2 t \nFig. 18-5 \n(i) When t > 2, both t - 2 and t + 1 are positive. So, U > 0 and the car is moving to the right. \n(ii) As t moves from (2, CO) through t = 2 into (-1, 2), the sign of t - 2 changes, but the sign of t + 1 \nremains the same. Hence, U changes from positive to negative. Thus, for - 1 < t < 2, the car is moving \nto the left. \n(iii) As t moves through t = - 1 from (- 1, 2) into (- a, - l), the sign of t + 1 changes but the sign of \nt - 2 remains the same. Hence, U changes from negative to positive. So, the car is moving to the right \nwhen t < - 1. \nWhen t = -1, \ns = 2(- 1)3 - 3(- 1)2 - 12(- 1) = -2 - 3 + 12 = 7 \nWhen t = 2 \ns = 2(2)3 - 3(2)2 - 12(2) = 16 - 12 - 24 = -20 \nThus, the car moves to the right until, at t = - 1, it reaches s = 7, where it reverses direction and moves left \nuntil, at t = 2, it reaches s = -20, where it reverses direction again and keeps moving to the right thereafter \n(see Fig. 18-6). \nFig. 18-6 \nCHAP. 181 RECTILINEAR MOTION AND INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY 141 \nThe car is never at rest.

A change in the \nvalue of x usually induces a corresponding change in the value of y. \nEXAMPLE Let x be the length of the side of a cube, and let y be the volume of the cube. Then y = x3. In the case \nwhere the side has length x = 2 units, consider a small change Ax in the length. \nNOTATION Ax (read \u201cdelta-ex\u201d) is the traditional symbol in calculus for a small change in x. Ax is considered a \nsingle symbol, not a product of A and x. In earlier chapters, the role of Ax often was taken by the symbol h. \nThe new volume will be (2 + Ax)~, and so the change in the value of the volume y is (2 + Ax)~ - Z3. This change in \ny is denoted traditionally by Ay, \nAy = (2 + Ax)~ - 23 \nNow the natural way to compare the change Ay in y to the change Ax in x is to calculate the ratio Ay/Ax. This \nratio depends of course on Ax, but if we let Ax approach 0, then the limit of Ay/Ax will define the instantaneous rate \nof change of y compared to x, when x = 2. We have (ALGEBRA, Problem 11.2) \nAy = (2 + Ax)~ - 23 = [(2)3 + 3(2)2(A~)1 + 3(2)\u2019(A~)~ + (Ax)~] - 23 \n= 126~ + ~(Ax)~ + (Ax)~ = (AxX12 + 6Ax + (Ax)~) \nHence, -- Ay - 12 + 6Ax + (Ax)\u2019 Ax \nand AY lim - = lim (12 + 6Ax + (AX)~) = 12 \nAx-0 Ax Ax+O \nTherefore, when the side is 2, the rate of change of the volume with respect to the side is 12. This means that, for \nsides close to 2, the change Ay in the volume is approximately 12 times the change Ax in the side (since Ay/Ax is \nclose to 12). Let us look at a few numerical cases. \nIf Ax = 0.1, then the new side x + Ax is 2.1, and the new volume is (2.1)3 = 9.261. So, Ay = 9.261 - 8 = 1.261, \nand \nAy 1.261 \nAx 0.1 \n-- - - = 12.61 \nIf Ax = 0.01, then the new side x + Ax is 2.01, and the new volume is (2.01)3 = 8.120601. So, \nAy = 8.120601 - 8 = 0.120601, and \n12.0601 Ay 0.120601 \nAx 0.01 \n-=-= \nIf Ax = 0.001, a similar computation yields \n-- Ay - 12.006001 Ax \nLet us extend the result of the above example from y = x3 to an arbitrary differentiable function \ny =f(x). Consider a small change Ax in the value of the argument x. The new value of the argument is \n143 \n[CHAP. 19 144 INSTANTANEOUS RATE OF CHANGE \nthen x + Ax, and the new value of y will bef(x + Ax). Hence, the change Ay in the value of the function \nis \nAy =f(x + Ax) - f(x) \nThe ratio of the change in the function value to the change in the argument is \nThe instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x is defined to be \nAY lim -= lim \nAx-OAx Ax-0 Ax \nThe instantaneous rate of change is evaluated by the derivative. It follows that, for Ax close to 0, Ay/Ax \nwill be close tof\u2019(x), so that \nAy x f\u2019(x) Ax (1 9.1) \nSolved Problems \n19.1 The weekly profit P, in dollars, of a corporation is determined by the number x of radios pro- \nduced per week, according to the formula \nP = 75~ - 0.03~~ - 15000 \n(a) Find the rate at which the profit is changing when the production level x is loo0 radios per \nweek.

(To remember the sense of \u201cconcave upward,\u201d notice that the letters c and up form the \nword cup.) A mathematical description of this notion can be given. A curve is concave upward if the \ncurve lies above the tangent line at any given point of the curve. Thus, in Fig. 23-l(a) the curve lies \nabove all three tangent lines. \n/ \n/ \n/ \n/ \nFig. 23-1 Concavity *ward \nA curve is said to be concave downward if it has the shape of a cap or part of a cap (see Fig. 23-2). In \nmathematical terms, a curve is concave downward if it lies below the tangent line at an arbitrary point \nof the curve [see Fig. 23-2(a)]. \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n\\ \n(4 (b) \nFig. 23-2 Concavity downward \nA curve may, of course, be composed of parts of different concavity. The curve in Fig. 23-3 is \nconcave downward from A to B, concave upward from B to C, concave downward from C to D, and \nconcave upward from D to E. A point on the curve at which the concavity changes is called an inflection \npoint. B, C, and D are inflection points in Fig. 23-3. \n167 \n168 THE SECOND DERIVATIVE AND GRAPH SKETCHING [CHAP. 23 \nFig. 23-3 \nFrom Fig. 23-1 we see that if we move from left to right along a curve that is concave upward, the \nslope of the tangent line increases. The slope either becomes less negative or more positive. Conversely, \nif the tangent line has this property, the curve must be concave upward. Now for a curve y =f(x), the \ntangent line will certainly have this property iff\u201d(x) > 0 since, in that case, Theorem 17.3 implies that \nthe slopef\u2019(x) of the tangent line will be an increasing function. By a similar argument, we see that if \nf\u201d(x) < 0, the slope of the tangent line is decreasing, and from Fig. 23-2 we see that the curve y =f(x) is \nconcave downward. This yields: \nTheorem 23.l: Iff\u201d(x) > 0 for all x in (a, b), then the graph off is concave upward between x = a and \nx = b. Iff\u201d(x) < 0 for all x in (a, b), then the graph offis concave downward between \nx = a and x = b. \nFor a rigorous proof of Theorem 23.1, see Problem 23.17. \nCorollary 23.2: If the graph off has an inflection point at x = c, and f\u201d exists and is continuous at \nx = c, then$\u201d@) = 0. \nIn fact, if f\u201d(c) # 0, the f\u201d(c) > 0 or f\u201d(c) < 0. If f\u201d(c) > 0, then f\u201d(x) > 0 for all x in some open \ninterval containing c, and the graph would be concave upward in that interval, contradicting the \nassumption that there is an inflection point at x = c. We get a similar contradiction iff\u201d(c) < 0, for in \nthat case, the graph would be concave downward in an open interval containing c. \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Consider the graph of y = x3 [see Fig. 23-4(a)]. Here y\u2019 = 3x2 and y\u201d = 6x. Since y\u201d > 0 when x > 0, and \ny\u201d < 0 when x < 0, the curve is concave upward when x > 0, and concave downward when x < 0. There is an \ninflection point at the origin, where the concavity changes. This is the only possible inflection point, for if \ny\u201d = 6x = 0, then x must be 0. \n(b) Iff\u201d(c) = 0, the graph offneed not have an inflection point at x = c. For instance, the graph off($ = x4 [see \nFig. 23-4(b)] has a relative minimum, not an inflection point, at x = 0, wheref\u201d(x) = 12x2 = 0. \nFig. 23-4 \nCHAP. 231 THE SECOND DERIVATIVE AND GRAPH SKETCHING 169 \n23.2 TEST FOR RELATIVE EXTREMA \nWe already know, from Chapter 14, that the conditionf'(c) = 0 is necessary, but not sufficient, for a \ndifferentiable function f to have a relative maximum or minimum at x = c. We need some additional \ninformation that will tell us whether a function actually has a relative extremum at a point where its \nderivative is zero. \nTheorem 23.3 (Second-Derivative Test for Relative Extrema): If f'(c) = 0 and f\"(c) < 0, then f has a \nrelative maximum at c. Iff'(c) = 0 andf\"(c) > 0, thenfhas a relative minimum at c. \nProof: Iff'(c) = 0, the tangent line to the graph off is horizontal at x = c. If, in addition,f\"(c) -c 0, \nthen, by Theorem 23.1,' the graph off is concave downward near x = c. Hence, near x = c, the graph \noff must lie below the horizontal line through (c, f(c));f thus has a relative maximum at x = c [see \nFig. 23-5(a)]. A similar argument leads to a relative minimum whenf\"(c) > 0 [see Fig. 23-5(b)]. \nI \nI I \nI I \nC C \nI 1 \nEXAMPLE Consider the functionf(x) = 2x3 + x2 - 4x + 2. Then, \nf'(x) =r 6x2 + 2x - 4 = 2(3x2 + x - 2) = 2(3x - 2Xx + 1) \nHence, iff'(x) = 0, then 3x - 2 = 0 or x + 1 = 0; that is, x = 3 or x = - 1. Nowf\"(x) = 12x + 2. Hence, \nf\"(-1) = 12(-1) + 2 = -12 + 2 = -10 < 0 \nf''(4) = 12(3) + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 > 0 \nFig. 23-6 \nIn order to use Theorem 23.1, we must assume that f\" is continuous at c and exists in an open interval around c.

We can determine that - 1 is a root of x3 - 3x2 + 4. \nALGEBRA When looking for roots of a polynomial, first test the integral factors of the constant. In this \ncase, the factors of 4 are f 1, f 2, +4. \nSo (Theorem 7.2),f\u2019(x) is divisible by x + 1. The division yields \nX\u2019 - 3x2 + 4 = (X + l)(x2 - 4~ + 4) = (X + 1Xx - 2)2 \nHence, the critical numbers are x = - 1 and x = 2. Now \nf\u201d(x) = 3x2 - 6~ = ~X(X - 2) \nThus, f\u201d( - 1) = 3( - 1X- 1 - 2) = 9. Hence, by the second-derivative test, f has a relative minimum at \nx= -1. \nSincef\u201d(2) = 3(2)(2 - 2) = 0, we do the first-derivative test at x = 2. \nf\u2018(x) = (X + 1Xx - 2)2 \nOn both sides of x = 2, f\u2019(x) > 0, since x + 1 > 0 and (x - 2)\u2019 > 0. This is the case { +, + }. There is an \ninflection point at (2,6). Furthermore,f\u201d(x) changes sign at x = 0, so that there is also an inflection point at \n(0,2).

The following result often enables us to handle cases where \nthe function is defined on a half-open interval, open interval, infinite interval, or the set of all real \nnumbers. Remember that, in general, there is no guarantee that a function has an absolute maximum or \nan absolute minimum on such domains. \nTheorem 24.1: Let f be a continuous function on an interval 9, with a single relative extremum within \n9. Then this relative extremum is also an absolute extremum on 9. \nIntuitive Argument: Refer to Fig. 24-1. Suppose that f has a relative maximum at c and no other \nrelative extremum inside 3. Take any other number d in 9. The curve moves down- \nward on both sides of c. Hence, if the valuef(d) were greater thanf(c), then, at some \npoint U between c and d, the curve would have to change direction and start moving \nupward. But then f would have a relative minimum at U, contradicting our assumption. \nThe result for a relative minimum follows by applying to -f the result just obtained \nfor a relative maximum. \nFor a rigorous proof, see Problem 24.20. \n1 1 1 * \nC U d \nFig. 24-1 \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Find the salortest 4 istance from the point P(1,O) to the parabola x = y2 [see Fig. 24-2(a)]. \nThe distance from an arbitrary point Q(x, y) on the parabola to the point P(1,O) is, by (24, \nU=J- \n= d- [y2 = x at Q] \n=Jx2-2X+l+x=J- \nBut minimizing U is equivalent to minimizing u2 = F(x) = x2 - x + 1 on the interval CO, + co) (the value of x \nis restricted by the fact that x = y2 2 0). \nF(x) = 2x - 1 F\u201d(x) = 2 \nor x = 3 \nThe only critical number is the solution of \nF(x) = 2x - 1 = 0 \nNow F\u201d(3) = 2 > 0.

The bottom of the box costs 3 cents per square inch, whereas the \nsides cost 2 cents per square inch. Find the dimensions that will minimize the cost of the box. \nLet x be the side of the square bottom, and let h be the height. Then the cost of the bottom is 3x2 and the \ncost of each of the four sides is 2xh, giving a total cost of \nC = 3x2 + 4(2xh) = 3x2 + 8xh \nThe volume is V = 48 = x2h.

A complete rotation is divided \ninto 360 equal parts, and the measure assigned to each part is called a degree. In modern mathematics \nand science, it is useful to define a different unit of angle measure. \nDefinition: Consider a circle with a radius of one unit [see Fig. 25-l(b)]. Let the center be C, and let \nCA and CB be two radii for which the intercepted arc A% of the circle has length 1. Then \nthe central angle ACB is taken to be the unit of measure, one radian. \nLet X be the number of degrees in 3;ACB of radian measure 1. Then the ratio of X to 360\" (a \ncomplete rotation) is the same as the ratio of A% to the entire circumference, 211. Since A% = 1, \n360 180 or X=-=- x1 --- \n360 - 211 211 It \n(25.1) 180 Thus, 1 radian = - degrees \n11 \nIf we approximate 11 as 3.14, then 1 radian is about 57.3 degrees.

For any given \nnumber 8, rotate about the point 0 through an angle with radian measure 8. Let 0 \nbe the final position of the arrow after the rotation. Then: (i) the x-coordinate of B is \ndefined to be the cosine of 8, denoted by cos 8; (ii) the y-coordinate of B is defined to be \nthe sine of 8, denoted by sin 8. Thus, B = (cos 8, sin 8). \n- \n1 X \nf' \n,\\ I \\ \nFig. 26-1 \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Let 8 = n/2.

This is true for all \nfunctions. If g(x) is an antiderivative off(x), then g(x) + C is also an antiderivative off(x), where C is \nany constant. The reason is that Dx(C) = 0, whence \nLet us find the relationship between any two antiderivatives of a function. \nTheorem 29.1: If F'(x) = 0 for all x in an interval Y, then F(x) is a constant on 9. \nThe assumption F'(x) = 0 tells us that the graph of F always has a horizontal tangent. It is then \nobvious that the graph of F must be a horizontal straight line; that is, F(x) is constant. For a rigorous \nproof, see Problem 29.4. \nCorollary 29.2: If g'(x) = h'(x) for all x in an interval Y, then there is a constant C such that \ng(x) = h(x) + C for all x in Y. \nIndeed, \nD,(g(x) - h(x)) = g'(x) - h'(x) = 0 \nwhence, by Theorem 29.1, g(x) - h(x) = C, or g(x) = h(x) + C. \nThus, if we know one antiderivative of a function, we know them all. \nAccording to Corollary 29.2, any two antiderivatives of a given function differ only by a constant. \nNOTATION If(.) dx stands for any antiderivative ofJ Thus, \nOTHER TERMINOLOGY Sometimes the term indefinite integral is used instead of antiderivative, and the process of \nfinding antiderivatives is termed integration.

This follows from the fact that In y is an increasing \nfunction with domain (0, + 00) and range the set of all real numbers. (See the graph of the In function in \nFig. 34-2.) \n35.2 PROPERTIES OF ax \nIt is shown in Problem 35.4 that the function ax possesses all the standard properties of powers: \n(I) ao = I. \n(11) a' = a. \n(111) a\"+' = aUaV. \n1 (V) a-v=- \nav * \n(VI) (ab)\" = aXbX. \naX (VII) (;) =b\". \n(VIII) (a\")\" = a\"'. \n35.3 THE FUNCTION ex \nFor a particular choice of the positive real number a, the function ax becomes the inverse of the \nfunction In x. \nTERMINOLOGY Two functionsfand g are inoerses of each other iffundoes the effect of 9, and g undoes the effect of \nf.

It can be \nshown that e = 2.718 .... [See Problem 35.3o(c).] \nTkorem 35.1: The functions e\" and In x are inverses of each other: \nIn ex = x and elnx -x - \nIndeed, substituting e for U in (354, \nIn ex = x In e = x 1 = x \nIf we replace x in this result by In x, \nIn elnx = In x \nHence, ,1nx - - x [since In u = In U implies u = U by Property 10, Section 34.21 \nTheorem 35.1 shows that the natural logarithm In x is what one would call the \"logarithm to the \nbase e\"; that is, In x is the power to which e has to be raised to obtain x: ,Inx - - x. \nTheorem 35.2: ax = e\" In '. \nThus, every exponential function a\" is definable in terms of the particular exponential function ex, \nwhich for this reason is often referred to as the exponential function. To see why Theorem 35.2 is true, \nnotice that, by Theorem 35.1, \nIn ex'\"' = x In a \nBut y = ux is the unique solution of the equation In y = x In a. Therefore, \n,xlna - - ax \nIn Problem 35.9 it is shown that ex is differentiable and that: \nTheorem 35.3: Dx(e\") = ex. \nThus, ex has the property of being its own derivative. All constant multiples Ce\" share this property, \nsince Dx(Cex) = C Dx(ex) = Ce\". Problem 35.28 shows that these are the only functions with this \nproperty. \nFrom Theorem 35.3, we have \nex dx = ex + C (35.3) \ns \nKnowing the derivative of ex, we obtain from Theorem 35.2 \nD,(aX) = DX(ex'\"') = e\"In' D,(x In a) [by the chain rule] \nIn a = ax In a - - ex In a . \nThis proves : \nTheorem 35.4: \nor, in terms of antiderivatives, /a. dx = + c \nWe know that Dx(Y) = r$-' for any rational number T.

Moreover, since D;(e? = ex > 0, the graph will be concave upward for \nall x. The graph is shown in Fig. 35-l(a). \nBy Theorem 35.1, y = ex is equivalent to x = In y.

If K > 0, K is called a growth constant, and \ny increases exponentially with time. If K < 0, K is called a decay constant, and y decreases exponentially \nwith time. \nLet y, be the value of y at t = 0.

[For example, \nIn (1.02) x 0.0198 and In (1.03) x 0.02956.1 Thus, many textbooks will automatically interpret a rate of \nincrease of r percent per unit time to mean that K = O.Or. \nIf the decay constant of a given radioactive element is K < 0, compute the time T after which only half of any \noriginal quantity remains. \nAt t = T, (36.3) gives \n-In2=KT In-=-lnx \n[I 1 \nIn 2 \nK --- -T (36.4) \nThe number T is called the half-life of the given element.

Not all functions, however, have inverses. \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Consider the function f such that f(x) = x2 for all x. Then f( 1) = 1 and f( - 1) = 1. If there were an inverse g \nof f, then g(f(x)) = x. Therefore, g(1) = g(f(1)) = 1 and g(1) = g(f(- 1)) = - 1, implying that 1 = - 1, \nwhich is impossible. \n(b) Letfbe any periodic function,f(x + p) =f(x), for all x (see Section 26.2). The argument of example (a), for two \npoints xo and xo + p, shows that f cannot have an inverse. Now all the trigonometric functions are periodic \n(with either p = 2n or p = n). Hence, the trigonometric functions do not have inverses! \nThe functions that have inverses turn out to be the one-one functions. \nDefinition: A functionfis one-one if, whenever U # v, \nf (U) # f (0) \nThus, a one-one function takes different numbers into different numbers. A function is one-one if \nand only if its graph intersects any horizontal line in at most one point.

It carefully develops, giving all steps, the principles \nof differentiation and integration on which the whole of calculus is built. The book is suitable for \nreviewing the subject, or as a self-contained text for an elementary calculus course.\nThe author has found that many of the difficulties students encounter in calculus are due to weakness in \nalgebra and arithmetical computation, emphasis has been placed on reviewing algebraic and \narithmetical techniques whenever they are used. Every effort has been made\u2014especially in regard to \nthe composition of the solved problems\u2014 to ease the beginner's entry into calculus. There are also some \n1500 supplementar", "s whenever they are used. Every effort has been made\u2014especially in regard to \nthe composition of the solved problems\u2014 to ease the beginner's entry into calculus. There are also some \n1500 supplementary problems (with a complete set of answers at the end of the book). \nHigh school courses in calculus can readily use this Outline. Many of the problems are adopted from \nquestions that have appeared in the Advanced Placement Examination in Calculus, so that students will \nautomatically receive preparation for that test.\nThe Second Edition has been improved by the following changes:\n1. A large number of problems have been added to take advantage of the availability of graphing \ncalculators. Such problems are preceded by the notation . Solution of these problems is not \nnecessary for comprehension of the text, so that students not having a graphing calculator will not \nsuffer seriously from that lack (except insofar as the use of a graphing calculator enhances their \nunderstanding of the sub", "on of the text, so that students not having a graphing calculator will not \nsuffer seriously from that lack (except insofar as the use of a graphing calculator enhances their \nunderstanding of the subject).\n2. Treatment of several topics have been expanded:\n(a) Newton's Method is now the subject of a separate section. The availability of calculators makes \nit much easier to work out concrete problems by this method.\n(b) More attention and more problems are devoted to approximation techniques for integration, such \nas the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and the midpoint rule.\n(c) The chain rule now has a complete proof outlined in an exercise.\n3. The exposition has been streamlined in many places and a substantial number of new problems have \nbeen added.\nThe author wishes to thank again the editor of the First Edition, David Beckwith, as well as the editor of \nthe Second Edition, Arthur Biderman, and the editing supervisor, Maureen Walker.\nELLIOTT MENDELSON\n\nThis page intentionally le", "he editor of the First Edition, David Beckwith, as well as the editor of \nthe Second Edition, Arthur Biderman, and the editing supervisor, Maureen Walker.\nELLIOTT MENDELSON\n\nThis page intentionally left blank \nContents\nChapter 1 \nCoordinate Systems on a Line\n 1\n1.1 The Coordinates of a Point\n1\n1.2 Absolute Value\n2\nChapter 2 \nCoordinate Systems in a Plane\n8\n2.1 The Coordinates of a Point\n8\n2.2 The Distance Formula\n9\n2.3 The Midpoint Formulas\n10\nChapter 3 \nGraphs of Equations\n14\nChapter 4 \nStraight Lines\n24\n4.1 Slope\n24\n4.2 Equations of a Line\n27\n4.3 Parallel Lines\n28\n4.4 Perpendicular Lines\n29\nChapter 5 \nIntersections of Graphs\n36\nChapter 6 \nSymmetry\n41\n6.1 Symmetry about a Line\n41\n \n  \n \nChapter 7 \nFunctions and Their Graphs\n46\n7.1 The Notion of a Function 46\n7.2 Intervals 48\n7.3 Even and Odd Functions 50\n7.4 Algebra Review: Zeros of Polynomials 51\nChapter 8 \nLimits\n59\n8.1 Introduction 59\n8.2 Properties of Limits 59\n8.3 Existence or Nonexistence of the Limit 61\nChapter 9 \nSpecial Limit", "Odd Functions 50\n7.4 Algebra Review: Zeros of Polynomials 51\nChapter 8 \nLimits\n59\n8.1 Introduction 59\n8.2 Properties of Limits 59\n8.3 Existence or Nonexistence of the Limit 61\nChapter 9 \nSpecial Limits\n 67\n9.1 One-Sided Limits\n67\n9.2 Infinite Limits: Vertical Asymptotes\n68\n9.3 Limits at Infinity: Horizontal Asymptotes\n70\nChapter 10 \nContinuity\n78\n10.1 Definition and Properties\n78\n10.2 One-Sided Continuity\n79\n10.3 Continuity over a Closed Interval\n80\n6.2 Symmetry about a Point 42\nChapter 11 \nThe Slope of a Tangent Line\n 86\nChapter 12 \nThe Derivative\n92\nChapter 13 \nMore on the Derivative\n99\n13.1 Differentiability and Continuity\n99\n13.2 Further Rules for Derivatives\n100\nChapter 14 \nMaximum and Minimum Problems\n104\n14.1 Relative Extrema\n104\n14.2 Absolute Extrema\n105\nChapter 15 \nThe Chain Rule\n116\n15.1 Composite Functions\n116\n \n15.2 Differentiation of Composite Functions 117\nChapter 16 \nImplicit Differentiation\n126\nChapter 17 \nThe Mean-Value Theorem and the Sign of the Derivative\n129\n17.1 R", "116\n15.1 Composite Functions\n116\n \n15.2 Differentiation of Composite Functions 117\nChapter 16 \nImplicit Differentiation\n126\nChapter 17 \nThe Mean-Value Theorem and the Sign of the Derivative\n129\n17.1 Rolle's Theorem and the Mean-Value Theorem 129\n17.2 The Sign of the Derivative 130\n \n  \nChapter 18 \nRectilinear Motion and Instantaneous Velocity\n 136\nChapter 19 \nInstantaneous Rate of Change\n143\nChapter 20 \nRelated Rates\n147\nChapter 21 \nApproximation by Differentials;

Choose a point 0 on the line and call this point the origin. \nNow select a direction along 9; say, the direction from left to right on the diagram. \nFor every point P to the right of the origin 0, let the coordinate of P be the distance between 0 and P. \n(Of course, to specify such a distance, it is first necessary to establish a unit distance by arbitrarily \npick", " to the right of the origin 0, let the coordinate of P be the distance between 0 and P. \n(Of course, to specify such a distance, it is first necessary to establish a unit distance by arbitrarily \npicking two points and assigning the number 1 to the distance between these two points.) \nIn the diagram \nthe distance is assumed to be 1, so that the coordinate of A is 1. The point B is two units away from \n0; therefore, B has coordinate 2. Every positive real number r is the coordinate of a unique point on 9 \nto the right of the origin 0; namely, of that point to the right of 0 whose distance from 0 is r. \nTo every point Q on 9 to the left of the origin 0, \n- we assign a negative real number as its coordinate; the number -Q0, the negative of the distance \nbetween Q and 0. For example, in the diagram \nthe point U is assumed to be a distance of one unit from the origin 0; therefore, the coordinate of U is \n- 1. The point W has coordinate -4, which means that the distance is *. Clearly, every ", "agram \nthe point U is assumed to be a distance of one unit from the origin 0; therefore, the coordinate of U is \n- 1. The point W has coordinate -4, which means that the distance is *. Clearly, every negative \nreal number is the coordinate of a unique point on 9 to the left of the origin. \nThe origin 0 is assigned the number 0 as its coordinate. \n1 \n[CHAP. 1 2 COORDINATE SYSTEMS ON A LINE \nThis assignment of real numbers to the points on the line 9 is called a coordinate system on 9. \nChoosing a different origin, a different direction along the line, or a different unit distance would result \nin a different coordinate system. \n1.2 ABSOLUTE VALUE \nFor any real number b define the absolute value I b I to be the magnitude of b; that is, \nb ifb20 \n-6 ifb<O lbl= \nIn other words, if b is a positive number or zero, its absolute value I b I is 6 itself. But if b is negative, its \nabsolute value I b I is the corresponding positive number - b. \nEXAMPLES \nProperties of the Absolute Value \nNotice ", "ive number or zero, its absolute value I b I is 6 itself. But if b is negative, its \nabsolute value I b I is the corresponding positive number - b. \nEXAMPLES \nProperties of the Absolute Value \nNotice that any number r and its negative -r have the same absolute value, \nIrl = 1-4 (1.1) \n(1 4 \nlal = lbl implies a= +b (1 -3) \nla12 = a\u2018 (1.4) \nAn important special case of (1.1) results from choosing r = U - U and recalling that -(U - U) = U - U, \nlu - U1 = lu - U1 \nIf I a I = I b I, then either a and b are the same number or a and b are negatives of each other, \nMoreover, since I a I is either a or -a, and ( -a)\u2019 = a\u2019, \nReplacing a in (1 4) by ab yields \nI ab l2 = (ab)2 = a2b2 = I U 1\u2019 I b 1\u2019 = (I U I I b I)\u2019 \nwhence, the absolute value being nonnegative, \nlab1 = lallbl \nAbsolute Value and Distance \nConsider a coordinate system on a line 9 and let A, and A2 be points on 9 with coordinates a, \nand a2.

If a is the coordinate of A, then \nI a I = distance between A and the origin \nNotice that, for any positive number c, \nlul I c is equivalent to -c I u I c \n1 1 1 *Y \n1 1 1 \n-C 0 C \nEXAMPLE lul S 3 ifand only if -3 I U I 3. \nSimilarly, lul < c is equivalent to -c < U < c (1.9) \nEXAMPLE To find a simpler form for the condition I x - 3 I < 5, substitute x - 3 for U in (1.9), obtaining \n- 5 < x - 3 < 5. Adding 3, we have - 2 < x < 8. From a geometric standpoint, note that I x - 3 I < 5 is equivalent \nto saying that the distance between the point A having coordinate x and the point havin", " < x - 3 < 5. Adding 3, we have - 2 < x < 8. From a geometric standpoint, note that I x - 3 I < 5 is equivalent \nto saying that the distance between the point A having coordinate x and the point having coordinate 3 is less than 5. \nI 1 I \nI 1 1 Y \n-2 3 8 \nIt follows immediately from the definition of the absolute value that, for any two numbers a and b, \n-1al I a I lal and -161 I 6 I lbl \n(In fact, either a = I a I or a = -1 a I.)

When x > 3, all three \nfactors are positive and the product is positive. As we pass from right to left through x = 3, the factor \n(x - 3) changes from positive to negative, and so the product will be negative between 1 and 3. As we pass \nfrom right to left through x = 1, the factor (x - 1) changes from positive to negative, and so the product \nchanges back from negative to positive throughout the interval between x = -2 and x = 1. Finally, as we \npass from right to left through x = -2, the factor (x + 2) changes from positive to negative, and so the \nproduct becomes negative for all x < -2. \n+ + \n1 1 I \nI I I Y \n-", "-2 and x = 1.

Take the vertical line through the point P, and let a be the \ncoordinate of the point where the line intersects the x-axis. This number a is called the x-coordinate of P \n(or the a6scissa of P). Now take the horizontal line through P, and let 6 be the coordinate of the point \nwhere the line intersects the y-axis. The number 6 is called the y-coordinate of P (or the ordinate of P). \nEvery po", ". Now take the horizontal line through P, and let 6 be the coordinate of the point \nwhere the line intersects the y-axis. The number 6 is called the y-coordinate of P (or the ordinate of P). \nEvery point has a unique pair (a, b) of coordinates associated with it. \nEXAMPLES In Fig. 2-2, the coordinates of several points have been indicated. We have limited ourselves to \ninteger coordinates only for simplicity. \nConversely, every pair (a, 6) of real numbers is associated with a unique point in the plane. \nEXAMPLES In the coordinate system of Fig. 2-3, to find the point having coordinates (3, 2), start at the origin 0, \nmove three units to the right and then two units upward. To find the point with coordinates (-2, 4), start at the \norigin 0, move two units to the left and then four units upward. To find the point with coordinates (- 1, - 3), start \nfrom the origin, move one unit to the left and then three units downward. \nGiven a coordinate system, the entire plane except for the points ", "ard. To find the point with coordinates (- 1, - 3), start \nfrom the origin, move one unit to the left and then three units downward. \nGiven a coordinate system, the entire plane except for the points on the coordinate axes can be \ndivided into four equal parts, called quadrants. All points with both coordinates positive form the first \nquadrant, quadrant I, in the upper right-hand corner (see Fig. 2-4). Quadrant I1 consists of all points \nwith negative x-coordinate and positive y-coordinate; quadrants I11 and IV are also shown in Fig. 2-4. \n8 \nCHAP. 23 \n4Y (-2.4) \nT 4 \nI \n4 \n4- \n(-2.3) 3- 0 (3.3) \n2- 0 (2.2) (5.2) + I \n(3.0) 1 \n-I + 1-1- \nI- (-4,I) \n1 111 1 IAI 1 \n-4 -3 -2-10 I 2 3 4 5 x %+* \n\u2018 -2, \n4 \n0 (-3. -2) -2(C (0, -2) \n-3 - 0 (4, -3) (-1,-3) 1 -3 \nCOORDINATE SYSTEMS IN A PLANE \n4Y \n4- \n3- \n2- 9 (3*2) \n1- \n3 4 5x \n- \n9 \n11 3- \n(-1.2) 0 2 \n(-. +) \nI 1 I \n-3 -2 -1 0 \n0 (-3,-1) -1 \n4Y \nI \n(+* +) \n- \nI\u2019 0 (2.1) \nI1 I \n1 2 3 \n- \nFig. 2-4 \nThe points having coordinates of the form (0,", "\n4- \n3- \n2- 9 (3*2) \n1- \n3 4 5x \n- \n9 \n11 3- \n(-1.2) 0 2 \n(-. +) \nI 1 I \n-3 -2 -1 0 \n0 (-3,-1) -1 \n4Y \nI \n(+* +) \n- \nI\u2019 0 (2.1) \nI1 I \n1 2 3 \n- \nFig. 2-4 \nThe points having coordinates of the form (0, b) are precisely the points on the y-axis.

We wish to find a formula for the distance PIP2. \nLet R be the point where the vertical line through P, intersects the horizontal line through P,. \nClearly, the x-coordinate of R is x2 , the same as that of P,; and the y-coordinate of R is y,, the same as \nthat of P,. By the Pythagorean theorem, \n- \n= Fp2 + P,R2 \nNow if A, .and A, are the projections of P, and P2 on t", "ate of R is x2 , the same as that of P,; and the y-coordinate of R is y,, the same as \nthat of P,. By the Pythagorean theorem, \n- \n= Fp2 + P,R2 \nNow if A, .and A, are the projections of P, and P2 on the x-axis, the segments P,R and A,& \nare opposite sides of a rectangle. Hence, P,R = A,& But A,A2 = Ix, - x, I by (1.6). Thus, -- \n= I x, - x2 I. Similarly, P, R = I y1 - y, I. Consequently, \nPlP,* = I x1 - x2 1, + I Yl - Y, 1, = (x, - x2), + 011 - Y,), \nPlP, = Jbl - x2I2 + b1 - Y,), whence \n[Equation (2.1) is called the distance formula.] The reader should check that this formula also holds \nwhen P, and P, lie on the same horizontal line or on the same vertical line. \n(2.1) \n10 COORDINATE SYSTEMS IN A PLANE [CHAP. 2 \n1\u2019 \nI I \nI I \nI I \nX \nFig. 2-5 \nY \nI I I \nI I I \nI I I \nX X \nFig. 2-6 \nEXAMPLES \n(a) The distance between (3, 8) and (7, 11) is \nJ(3 - 7)\u2019 + (8 - 11)\u2019 = ,/(-4)\u2019 + (-3)\u2019 = JW = JZ = 5 \n(b) The distance between (4, - 3) and (2,7) is \n,/(4 - 2)\u2019 + (-3 - 7)\u2019 = Jm = ,/- = @ \n= JGZ", "LES \n(a) The distance between (3, 8) and (7, 11) is \nJ(3 - 7)\u2019 + (8 - 11)\u2019 = ,/(-4)\u2019 + (-3)\u2019 = JW = JZ = 5 \n(b) The distance between (4, - 3) and (2,7) is \n,/(4 - 2)\u2019 + (-3 - 7)\u2019 = Jm = ,/- = @ \n= JGZ = J2* fi = 2fi \nALGEBRA For any positive numbers U and U, ,/& = fi &, since (A fi)2 = (&)\u2019(&)\u2019 = uu. \n(c) The distance between any point (a, b) and the origin (0,O) is Jm. \n2.3 THE MIDPOINT FORMULAS \nAgain considering two arbitrary points Pl(xl, y,) and P2(x2, y2), we shall find the coordinates (x, y) \nof the midpoint M of the segment P,P2 (Fig. 2-6). Let A, B, C be the perpendicular projections of P,, \nM, P2 on the x-axis. The x-coordinates of A, B, C are x,, x, x2, respectively. -- Since the lines P,A, MB, \nand P2 C are parallel, the ratios P1M/MP2 and B/BC are equal. But P,M = MP,; hence AB = E. \nSince AB = x - x1 and \n-- \n= x2 - x, \nx - x1= x2 - x \n2x = XI + x2 \nx1 +x2 \n2 \nx=- \n(The same result is obtained when P2 is to the left of P,, in which case AB = x1 - x and = x - x2.) \nSimilar", "B = E. \nSince AB = x - x1 and \n-- \n= x2 - x, \nx - x1= x2 - x \n2x = XI + x2 \nx1 +x2 \n2 \nx=- \n(The same result is obtained when P2 is to the left of P,, in which case AB = x1 - x and = x - x2.) \nSimilarly, y = (yl + y2)/2. Thus, the coordinates of the midpoint M are determined by the midpoint \nformulas \nYl +Y2 and y=- x1+ x2 x=- \n2 2 \nIn words, the coordinates of the midpoint are the averages of the coordinates of the endpoints. \nCHAP. 21 COORDINATE SYSTEMS IN A PLANE 11 \nEXAMPLES \n(a) The midpoint of the segment connecting (1, 7) and (3, 5) is (F, y) = (2,6). \n- (b) The point halfway between ( - 2, 5) and (3, 3) is (*, =) - - (i ,4). \n2 2 \nSolved Problems \n2.1 Determine whether the triangle with vertices A( - 1,2), B(4, 7), C( -3,6) is isosceles. \n- AB = J(-1 - 4)2 +(2 - 7)2 = J(-5)2 +(-5)2 = ,/ET% = Jso \nAC = J[ - 1 - ( -3)12 + (2 - 6)2 = Jw' = JGZ = JZ \nBC = J[4 - (-3)]' + (7 - 6)2 = J7T+1z = JZGT = Jso \n- \n- \nSince AB = E, the triangle is isosceles. \n2.2 Determine whether the triangl", " = ,/ET% = Jso \nAC = J[ - 1 - ( -3)12 + (2 - 6)2 = Jw' = JGZ = JZ \nBC = J[4 - (-3)]' + (7 - 6)2 = J7T+1z = JZGT = Jso \n- \n- \nSince AB = E, the triangle is isosceles. \n2.2 Determine whether the triangle with vertices A( - 5, - 3), B( - 7, 3), C(2,6) is a right triangle. \nUse (2.2) to find the squares of the sides, \n- AB2 = (-5 + 7)2 + (-3 - 3)2 = 22 + (-6)2 = 4 + 36 = 40 \nBC2 = (-7 - 2)2 + (3 - 6)2 = 81 + 9 = 90 \nAC2 = (-5 - 2)2 + (-3 - 6)2 = 49 + 81 = 130 \n- \n- \nSince AB2 + m2 = E2, AABC is a right triangle with right angle at B. \nGEOMETRY The converse of the Pythagorean theorem is also true: If x2 = AB2 + m2 in AABC, then \n<ABC is a right angle. \n2.3 Prove by use of coordinates that the midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equidistant \nfrom the three vertices. \nLet the origin of a coordinate system be located at the right angle C; let the positive x-axis contain leg \nCA and the positive y-axis leg CB [see Fig. 2-7(a)]. \nVertex A has coordinates (b, 0), where b = CA; and v", " of a coordinate system be located at the right angle C; let the positive x-axis contain leg \nCA and the positive y-axis leg CB [see Fig. 2-7(a)]. \nVertex A has coordinates (b, 0), where b = CA; and vertex B has coordinates (0, a), where a = E.

For example, the volume V of a cube is a function of the length s \nof a side. In fact, the dependence of V on s can be made precise through the formula V = s3. Such a \nspecific association of a number s3 with a given number s is what mathematicians usually mean by a \nfunction. \nIn Fig. 7-1, we picture a functionfas some sort of process which, from a number x, produces a \nnumberf(x); the number x is called an argument off and the numberf(x) is called the value off for the \nargument x. \nEXAMPLES \n(a) The square-root function associates wi", "h, from a number x, produces a \nnumberf(x); the number x is called an argument off and the numberf(x) is called the value off for the \nargument x. \nEXAMPLES \n(a) The square-root function associates with each nonnegative real number x the value &; that is, the unique \nnonnegative real number y such that y2 = x. \n(b) The doubling function g associates with each real number x the value 2x. Thus, g(3) = 6, \ng( - 1) = -2, g(&) = 2a. \nThe graph of a functionfconsists of all points (x, y) such that y =f(x). Thus, the graph off is the \ngraph of the equation y =f(x). \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Consider the functionfsuch thatf(x) = x + 1 for all x. The graph off is the set of all points (x, y) such that \ny = x + 1. This is a straight line, with slope 1 and y-intercept 1 (see Fig. 7-2). \n(b) The graph of the functionfsuch thatf(x) = x2 for all x consists of all points (x, y) such that y = x2. This is the \nparabola of Fig. 3-2. \n(c) Consider the function f such that f(x) = x3 for all x. In Fig. 7-3(a), we hav", "ctionfsuch thatf(x) = x2 for all x consists of all points (x, y) such that y = x2. This is the \nparabola of Fig. 3-2. \n(c) Consider the function f such that f(x) = x3 for all x. In Fig. 7-3(a), we have indicated a few points on the \ngraph, which is sketched in Fig. 7-3(b). \nThe numbers x for which a functionfproduces a valuef(x) form a collection of numbers, called the \ndomain off. For example, the domain of the square-root function consists of all nonnegative real \nOUTPUT INPUT NNCnON \n(argument) (value) \nf (x) - \nFig. 7-1 Fig. 7-2 \n46 \nCHAP. 71 FUNCTIONS AND THEIR GRAPHS \n2718 \nAY \n(4 \nFig. 7-3 \n47 \nnumbers; the function is not defined for negative arguments.

Indeed, for every nonnegative \nreal number y there is some number x such that & = y; namely, the number y2. \n(b) The range of the doubling function consists of all real numbers. Indeed, for every real number y there exists a \nreal number x such that 2x = y; namely, the number y/2. \n(c) Consider the absolute-value function h, defined by h(x) = I x I. The domain consists of all real numbers, but the \nrange is made up of all nonnegative real numbers. The graph is shown in Fig. 7-4.

The perpendicular \nprojection of all points of the graph onto the y-axis shows that the range consists of all y such that y 2 0. \nbY \nFig. 7-4 \n(d) Consider the function g defined by the formula g(x) = ,/=, whenever this formula makes sense. Here the \nvalue ,/= is defined only when 1 - x 2 0; that is, only when x _< 1. So the domain of g consists of all real \nnumbers x such that x I 1. It is a little harder to find the range of g. Consider a real number y; it will belong \nto the range of g if we can find some number x such that y = ,/=.

To determine the range off; notice that as x varies from - 1 to \n0, x2 varies from 1 to 0, 1 - x2 varies from 0 to 1, and ,/= also varies from 0 to 1. Similarly, as x varies from 0 \nto 1, ,/= varies from 1 to 0. Hence, the range offis the closed interval [0, 13.

It will be necessary \nto see how the valuef(x) of a functionfbehaves as the argument x approaches a given number. This \nleads to the idea of limit. \nEXAMPLE Consider the function fsuch that \nwhenever this formula makes sense.

What happens to the value f(x) as x approaches 3? Well, x2 approaches 9, and so x2 - 9 approaches 0; \nmoreover, x - 3 approaches 0. Since the numerator and the denominator both approach 0, it is not clear what \nx2 -9 happens to - x-3\u2019 \nHowever, upon factoring the numerator, we observe that \nx2 - 9 \nx-3 x-3 \n(X - 3)(x + 3) =x+3 -- - \nSince x + 3 unquestionably approaches 6 as x approaches 3, we now know that our function approaches 6 as x \napproaches 3.

As x approaches 0, the magnitude of l/x becomes larger and larger. (If x > 0, l/x is positive and \nvery large when x is close to 0. If x < 0, l/x is negative and very \u201csmall\u201d when x is close to 0.) \n(b) Figure 8-l(b) indicates that \n1x1 lim - \nx-ro x \ndoes not exist.

When x>O, 1x1 =x and IxI/x= 1; when x<O, 1x1 = -x and IxI/x= -1. Thus, as x \napproaches 0, IxI/x approaches two different values, 1 and -1, depending on whether x nears 0 through \npositive or through negative values. Since there is no unique limit as x approaches 0, we say that \n1x1 lim - \nx-ro x \ndoes not exist. \n(4 Let \nThen [see Fig. 8-l(c)], limf(x) does not exist.

If lirn f(x) = L, then L is a number to which f(x) can \nbe made arbitrarily close by letting x be sufliciently close to a. The value of L-or the very existence of \nL-is determined by the behavior offnear a, not by its value at a (if such a value even exists). \nx+a \nSolved Problems \n8.1 Find the following limits (if they exist): \n(a) Both y2 and l/y have limits as y + 2.

A mathematically precise version of this assertion is: For any real number E > 0, there exists \na real number 6 > 0 such that \n0 < Ix - a1 < 6 implies If(x) - LI c E \nfor any x in the domain off.

Remember that I x - a I < 6 means that the distance between x and a is \nsmaller than 6, and that I f(x) - L I < E means that the distance between f(x) and L is smaller than E. \nWe assume that the domain off is such that it contains at least one argument x within distance 6 of a \nfor arbitrary 6 > 0. Observe also that the condition 0 < I x - a I excludes consideration of x = a, in line \nwith the requirement that the value (if any) off@) has nothing to do with limf(x). \nA pictorial version of this definition is shown in Fig. 8-2. No matter how thin a horizontal strip (of \nwidth 24 that may be taken symmetrically above and below the line y = L, there is a thin vertical strip \n(of width 26) around the line x = a such that, for any x-coordinate of a point in this strip except x = a, \nthe corresponding point (x,f(x)) lies in the @ven horizontal strip.

Consider, for instance, an automobile moving \nalong a straight road. We can imagine a coordinate system imposed on the line containing the road (see \nFig. 18-1). (On many highways there actually is such a coordinate system, with markers along the side \nof the road indicating the distance from one end of the highway.) Ifs designates the coordinate of the \nautomobile and t denotes the time, then the motion of the automobile is specified by expressing s, its \nposition, as ", "g the distance from one end of the highway.) Ifs designates the coordinate of the \nautomobile and t denotes the time, then the motion of the automobile is specified by expressing s, its \nposition, as a function oft: s =f(t). \n1 L 1 I 1 I 1 1 & \n-3-2-1 0 I2 3 4 S \nFig. 18-1 \nThe speedometer indicates how fast the automobile is moving. Since the speedometer reading often \nvaries continuously, it is obvious that the speedometer indicates how fast the car is moving at the \nmoment when it is read. Let us analyze this notion in order to find the mathematical concept that lies \nbehind it. \nIf the automobile moves according to the equation s =f(t), its position at time t isf(t), and at time \nt + h, very close to time t, its position isf(t + h). The distance\u2019 between its position at time t and its \nposition at time t + h isf(t + h) -f(t) (which can be negative). The time elapsed between t and t + h is \nh. Hence, the average velocity2 during this time interval is \nf(t + h) -m \nh \n(Average veloci", "\nposition at time t + h isf(t + h) -f(t) (which can be negative). The time elapsed between t and t + h is \nh. Hence, the average velocity2 during this time interval is \nf(t + h) -m \nh \n(Average velocity = displacement - time.) Now as the elapsed time h gets closer to 0, the average veloc- \nity approaches what we intuitively think of as the instantaneous velocity U at time t. Thus, \nv = lim f(t + h) -f(O \nh h-0 \nIn other words, the instantaneous velocity v is the derivative f\u2019(t). \nEXAMPLES \n(a) The height s of a water column is observed to follow the law s =f(t) = 3t + 2. Thus, the instantaneous veloc- \nity U of the top surface isf\u2019(t) = 3. \n(6) The position s of an automobile along a highway is given by s =f(t) = t2 - 2t. Hence, its instantaneous \nvelocity is U =f\u2018(t) = 2t - 2. At time t = 3, its velocity U is 2(3) - 2 = 4. \nThe sign of the instantaneous velocity v indicates the direction in which the object is moving. If \nU = ds/dt > 0 over a time interval, Theorem 17.3 tells us that", "= 3, its velocity U is 2(3) - 2 = 4. \nThe sign of the instantaneous velocity v indicates the direction in which the object is moving. If \nU = ds/dt > 0 over a time interval, Theorem 17.3 tells us that s is increasing in that interval. Thus, if the \ns-axis is horizontal and directed to the right, as in Fig. 18-2(a), then the object is moving to the right; \nbut if the s-axis is vertical and directed upward, as in Fig. 18-2(b), then the object is moving upward. On \nMore precisely, the displacement, since it can be positive, negative, or zero. \n\u2019 We use the term velocity rather than speed because the quantity referred to can be negative.

In \nFig. 18-2(a), the object would be moving to the left (in the direction of decreasing s); in Fig. 18-2(b), the \nobject would be moving downward. \nA consequence of these facts is that at an instant t when a continuously mooing object reverses \ndirection, its instantaneous oelocity o must be 0. For if U were, say, positive at t, it would be positive in a \nsmall interval of time surrounding t; the object would therefore be moving in the same direction just \nbefore and just after t. Or, to say the same thing in a slightly different way, a reversal in direction means \na relative extremum of s, which in turn implies (Theorem 14.1) ds/dt = 0. \n\\ \nEXAMPLE An object moves along a straight line as indicated in Fig. 18-3(a).

A change in the \nvalue of x usually induces a corresponding change in the value of y. \nEXAMPLE Let x be the length of the side of a cube, and let y be the volume of the cube. Then y = x3. In the case \nwhere the side has length x = 2 units, consider a small change Ax in the length. \nNOTATION Ax (read \u201cdelta-ex\u201d) is the traditional symbol in calculus for a small change in x. Ax is considered a \nsingle symbol, not a product of A and x. In earlier chapters, the role of Ax often was taken by the symbol h. \nThe new volume will be (2 + Ax)~, and so the change in the v", "ge in x. Ax is considered a \nsingle symbol, not a product of A and x. In earlier chapters, the role of Ax often was taken by the symbol h. \nThe new volume will be (2 + Ax)~, and so the change in the value of the volume y is (2 + Ax)~ - Z3. This change in \ny is denoted traditionally by Ay, \nAy = (2 + Ax)~ - 23 \nNow the natural way to compare the change Ay in y to the change Ax in x is to calculate the ratio Ay/Ax. This \nratio depends of course on Ax, but if we let Ax approach 0, then the limit of Ay/Ax will define the instantaneous rate \nof change of y compared to x, when x = 2. We have (ALGEBRA, Problem 11.2) \nAy = (2 + Ax)~ - 23 = [(2)3 + 3(2)2(A~)1 + 3(2)\u2019(A~)~ + (Ax)~] - 23 \n= 126~ + ~(Ax)~ + (Ax)~ = (AxX12 + 6Ax + (Ax)~) \nHence, -- Ay - 12 + 6Ax + (Ax)\u2019 Ax \nand AY lim - = lim (12 + 6Ax + (AX)~) = 12 \nAx-0 Ax Ax+O \nTherefore, when the side is 2, the rate of change of the volume with respect to the side is 12. This means that, for \nsides close to 2, the change Ay in the volume is app", " + (AX)~) = 12 \nAx-0 Ax Ax+O \nTherefore, when the side is 2, the rate of change of the volume with respect to the side is 12. This means that, for \nsides close to 2, the change Ay in the volume is approximately 12 times the change Ax in the side (since Ay/Ax is \nclose to 12). Let us look at a few numerical cases. \nIf Ax = 0.1, then the new side x + Ax is 2.1, and the new volume is (2.1)3 = 9.261. So, Ay = 9.261 - 8 = 1.261, \nand \nAy 1.261 \nAx 0.1 \n-- - - = 12.61 \nIf Ax = 0.01, then the new side x + Ax is 2.01, and the new volume is (2.01)3 = 8.120601. So, \nAy = 8.120601 - 8 = 0.120601, and \n12.0601 Ay 0.120601 \nAx 0.01 \n-=-= \nIf Ax = 0.001, a similar computation yields \n-- Ay - 12.006001 Ax \nLet us extend the result of the above example from y = x3 to an arbitrary differentiable function \ny =f(x). Consider a small change Ax in the value of the argument x. The new value of the argument is \n143 \n[CHAP. 19 144 INSTANTANEOUS RATE OF CHANGE \nthen x + Ax, and the new value of y will bef(x + ", "y =f(x). Consider a small change Ax in the value of the argument x. The new value of the argument is \n143 \n[CHAP. 19 144 INSTANTANEOUS RATE OF CHANGE \nthen x + Ax, and the new value of y will bef(x + Ax). Hence, the change Ay in the value of the function \nis \nAy =f(x + Ax) - f(x) \nThe ratio of the change in the function value to the change in the argument is \nThe instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x is defined to be \nAY lim -= lim \nAx-OAx Ax-0 Ax \nThe instantaneous rate of change is evaluated by the derivative. It follows that, for Ax close to 0, Ay/Ax \nwill be close tof\u2019(x), so that \nAy x f\u2019(x) Ax (1 9.1) \nSolved Problems \n19.1 The weekly profit P, in dollars, of a corporation is determined by the number x of radios pro- \nduced per week, according to the formula \nP = 75~ - 0.03~~ - 15000 \n(a) Find the rate at which the profit is changing when the production level x is loo0 radios per \nweek.

A point on the cur", " of parts of different concavity. The curve in Fig. 23-3 is \nconcave downward from A to B, concave upward from B to C, concave downward from C to D, and \nconcave upward from D to E. A point on the curve at which the concavity changes is called an inflection \npoint. B, C, and D are inflection points in Fig. 23-3. \n167 \n168 THE SECOND DERIVATIVE AND GRAPH SKETCHING [CHAP. 23 \nFig. 23-3 \nFrom Fig. 23-1 we see that if we move from left to right along a curve that is concave upward, the \nslope of the tangent line increases. The slope either becomes less negative or more positive. Conversely, \nif the tangent line has this property, the curve must be concave upward. Now for a curve y =f(x), the \ntangent line will certainly have this property iff\u201d(x) > 0 since, in that case, Theorem 17.3 implies that \nthe slopef\u2019(x) of the tangent line will be an increasing function. By a similar argument, we see that if \nf\u201d(x) < 0, the slope of the tangent line is decreasing, and from Fig. 23-2 we see that th", "hat \nthe slopef\u2019(x) of the tangent line will be an increasing function. By a similar argument, we see that if \nf\u201d(x) < 0, the slope of the tangent line is decreasing, and from Fig. 23-2 we see that the curve y =f(x) is \nconcave downward. This yields: \nTheorem 23.l: Iff\u201d(x) > 0 for all x in (a, b), then the graph off is concave upward between x = a and \nx = b. Iff\u201d(x) < 0 for all x in (a, b), then the graph offis concave downward between \nx = a and x = b. \nFor a rigorous proof of Theorem 23.1, see Problem 23.17. \nCorollary 23.2: If the graph off has an inflection point at x = c, and f\u201d exists and is continuous at \nx = c, then$\u201d@) = 0. \nIn fact, if f\u201d(c) # 0, the f\u201d(c) > 0 or f\u201d(c) < 0. If f\u201d(c) > 0, then f\u201d(x) > 0 for all x in some open \ninterval containing c, and the graph would be concave upward in that interval, contradicting the \nassumption that there is an inflection point at x = c. We get a similar contradiction iff\u201d(c) < 0, for in \nthat case, the graph would be concave downward i", " upward in that interval, contradicting the \nassumption that there is an inflection point at x = c. We get a similar contradiction iff\u201d(c) < 0, for in \nthat case, the graph would be concave downward in an open interval containing c. \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Consider the graph of y = x3 [see Fig. 23-4(a)]. Here y\u2019 = 3x2 and y\u201d = 6x. Since y\u201d > 0 when x > 0, and \ny\u201d < 0 when x < 0, the curve is concave upward when x > 0, and concave downward when x < 0. There is an \ninflection point at the origin, where the concavity changes.

We need some additional \ninformation that will tell us whether a function actually has a relative extremum at a point where its \nderivative is zero. \nTheorem 23.3 (Second-Derivative Test for Relative Extrema): If f'(c) = 0 and f\"(c) < 0, then f has a \nrelative maximum at c. Iff'(c) = 0 andf\"(c) > 0, thenfhas a relative minimum at c. \nProof: Iff'(c) = 0, the tangent line to the graph off is horizontal at x = c. If, in addition,f\"(c) -c 0, \nthen, by Theorem 23.1,' the graph off is concave downward near x = c. Hence, near x = c, the graph \noff must lie below the horizontal line through (c, f(c));f thus has a relative maximum at x = c [see \nFig. 23-5(a)]. A similar argument leads to a relative minimum ", " = c. Hence, near x = c, the graph \noff must lie below the horizontal line through (c, f(c));f thus has a relative maximum at x = c [see \nFig. 23-5(a)].

The following result often enables us to handle cases where \nthe function is defined on a half-open interval, open interval, infinite interval, or the set of all real \nnumbers. Remember that, in general, there is no guarantee that a function has an absolute maximum or \nan absolute minimum on such domains. \nTheorem 24.1: Let f be a continuous function on an interval 9, with a single relative extremum within \n9.

Then this relative extremum is also an absolute extremum on 9. \nIntuitive Argument: Refer to Fig. 24-1. Suppose that f has a relative maximum at c and no other \nrelative extremum inside 3. Take any other number d in 9. The curve moves down- \nward on both sides of c. Hence, if the valuef(d) were greater thanf(c), then, at some \npoint U between c and d, the curve would have to change direction and start moving \nupward. But then f would have a relative minimum at U, contradicting our assumption. \nThe result for a relative minimum follows by applying to -f the result just obtained \nfor a relative maximum. \nFor a rigorous proof, see Problem 24.20. \n1 1 1 * \nC U d \nFig. 24-1 \nEXAMPLES \n(a) Find the salortest 4 istance from the point P(1,O) to the parabola x = y2 [see Fig. 24-2(a)]. \nThe distance from an arbitrary point Q(x, y) on the parabola to the point P(1,O) is, by (24, \nU=J- \n= d", ") Find the salortest 4 istance from the point P(1,O) to the parabola x = y2 [see Fig. 24-2(a)]. \nThe distance from an arbitrary point Q(x, y) on the parabola to the point P(1,O) is, by (24, \nU=J- \n= d- [y2 = x at Q] \n=Jx2-2X+l+x=J- \nBut minimizing U is equivalent to minimizing u2 = F(x) = x2 - x + 1 on the interval CO, + co) (the value of x \nis restricted by the fact that x = y2 2 0). \nF(x) = 2x - 1 F\u201d(x) = 2 \nor x = 3 \nThe only critical number is the solution of \nF(x) = 2x - 1 = 0 \nNow F\u201d(3) = 2 > 0.

For any given \nnumber 8, rotate about the point 0 through an angle with radian measure 8. Let 0 \nbe the final position of the arrow after the rotation. Then: (i) the x-coordinate of B is \ndefined to be the cosine of 8, denoted by cos 8; (ii) the y-coordinate of B is defined to be \nthe sine of 8, denoted by sin 8.

This follows from the fact that In y is an increasing \nfunction with domain (0, + 00) and range the set of all real numbers. (See the graph of the In function in \nFig. 34-2.) \n35.2 PROPERTIES OF ax \nIt is shown in Problem 35.4 that the function ax possesses all the standard properties of powers: \n(I) ao = I. \n(11) a' = a. \n(111) a\"+' = aUaV. \n1 (V) a-v=- \nav * \n(VI) (ab)\" = aXbX. \naX (VII) (;) =b\". \n(VIII) (a\")\" = a\"'. \n35.3 THE FUNCTION ex \nFor a particular choice of the positive real number a, the function ax becomes the inverse of the \nfunction In x. \nTERMINOLOGY Two functionsfand g are inoerses of each other iffundoes the effect of 9, and g undoes the effect of \nf.

If there were an inverse g \nof f, then g(f(x)) = x. Therefore, g(1) = g(f(1)) = 1 and g(1) = g(f(- 1)) = - 1, implying that 1 = - 1, \nwhich is impossible. \n(b) Letfbe any periodic function,f(x + p) =f(x), for all x (see Section 26.2). The argument of example (a), for two \npoints xo and xo + p, shows that f cannot have an inverse. Now all the trigonometric functions are periodic \n(with either p = 2n or p = n). Hence, the trigonometric functions do not have inverses! \nThe functions that have inverses turn out to be the one-one functions. \nDefinition: A functionfis one-one if, whenever U # v, \nf (U) # f (0) \nThus, a one-one function takes different numbers into different numbers.
